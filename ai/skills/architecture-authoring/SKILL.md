description: Use this skill when writing or revising an architecture doc — the code-facing "types & interfaces" companion to a spec, under doc/devel/**/arch/. It defines the structure of an arch doc: the module home, the types and trait signatures as they will appear in code, crisp decision records, and a reconciliation table that converges on existing types instead of inventing new ones. Trigger on "write the architecture", "draft the arch doc / interfaces for X", "turn this spec into interfaces", or after a spec settles and before the implementation plan. Rests on a spec (spec-authoring); feeds the plan (implementation-plan-authoring). Borrows naming/defaults/errors/module-structure discipline from rust-code-review.

# Architecture-doc authoring

An **architecture doc is the code-facing distillation of a spec.** Where the spec answers
*what and why*, the arch doc answers ***how it appears in code***: the module home, the types
and trait signatures implementations plug into, the decisions in crisp record form, and the
map from these names to existing code. It points back to the spec for every *why* — it does
not re-argue them.

Exemplars: [`doc/devel/ng/arch/ng_step_interfaces.md`](../../../doc/devel/ng/arch/ng_step_interfaces.md)
(shared vocabulary + step traits), [`doc/devel/ng/arch/module_layout.md`](../../../doc/devel/ng/arch/module_layout.md)
(the module tree), and the per-step
[`doc/devel/ng/arch/read_filtering.md`](../../../doc/devel/ng/arch/read_filtering.md). Read
the closest match before writing.

## One reader, and one job — don't re-write the spec

**The reader is the coder about to implement this. Only them.** The manager — the spec's second
reader — already got their answers (what it costs, what it moves, what's still open) from the spec,
and does not read this. That is what makes the arch doc different from the spec, and it is the whole
discipline: **the arch doc adds exactly one thing the spec lacks — the types and signatures as they
appear in code — and for everything else it points back.**

This matters most when the spec is *detailed*. A thorough spec (say the sibling `spec-authoring`
skill's five-question one, run well) has already stated the traps, the reconciliation, the open
questions. The arch doc's failure mode is then not omission — it is **being a shorter copy of the
spec**. Every paragraph, ask: *is this the code shape, or is it the spec's material re-typed?* If
the latter, cut it to a cross-ref (`why: spec §4`). The arch doc is **shorter than its spec**, not a
condensation of it — its exemplar `read_filtering.md` is 261 lines against a longer spec. If yours
is approaching its spec's length, you are duplicating.

**The bar:** the coder builds from this doc + the spec without re-deciding anything, and never has
to reconstruct a type's shape or a trait's contract from prose. Not "could this survive design
review" — that bar produced defensive, re-argued arch docs; the coder does not need the argument,
they need the signature and the invariant.

## The governing stance

> **Signatures are illustrative; the contract is the deliverable.**

An arch doc commits to *shapes and contracts*, not final code. State each type and trait as it
will appear, with a doc comment that says what it is and the invariant it holds — then let the
implementation adjust the exact signature to the real API. What must be right is the contract
(what goes in, what comes out, what holds), the names, and the module boundaries.

Corollary: **don't over-specify what code review will settle.** Verbose copied-in schemas, full
method bodies, and tuning constants belong to the code, not the arch doc — pulling them forward
is a common RFC/design-doc failure mode (detail better suited to code review than doc review).
Sketch the interface; leave the body to the implementer.

## Structure (adapt; keep the spine)

1. **Header / status block.** "architecture draft (date), companion to `../spec/<name>.md`",
   plus a one-line pointer to the shared arch docs and the naming convention. If the shared
   step-interfaces doc defers this step's "real interface", say so — this doc *is* it.
2. **Module home.** Where it lives in the `src/` tree and why (file vs folder, which module it
   shares). Defer the tree-wide rules to the module-layout doc; state only this unit's placement.
3. **The types.** The domain newtypes it seeds/uses and the local types, as `rust` blocks with
   doc comments. Explanation above each block (progressive disclosure still applies).
4. **The interfaces.** The traits and the public surface, with doc-commented signatures and a
   one-paragraph **contract** (invariants, error behaviour, laziness, ownership).
5. **Design decisions — decided.** Crisp records, one line of *why* each, cross-referenced to
   the spec section that argued it. Open items marked `OPEN:`.
6. **Reconciliation with existing code.** The convergence table (below).
7. **Open items** — impl-time confirmations and any genuinely-unresolved boundary.
8. **Test/bench shape** (brief) — where tests live and what the regression anchor is.

## Code-shape discipline (borrowed from `rust-code-review` and the codebase)

The arch doc is where the code's conventions are locked in before code exists. Apply the
naming, defaults, errors, and module-structure rules from
[`rust-code-review`](../rust-code-review/SKILL.md) (its `code_review/naming.md`,
`defaults.md`, `errors.md`, `module_structure.md` checklists) at the *design* stage:

- **Newtypes for domain scalars; nouns for types, verbs for functions.** Every same-primitive
  quantity that could be transposed gets its own type so the compiler refuses the mix
  (`ContigId`, `MapQual`, `Bp`). Constrained scalars hide their field behind a checked
  constructor; unconstrained ones keep a `pub` field and `.get()`.
- **Modules named for the concept they own**, never a layer or pattern (`allele_candidates`,
  `likelihood` — never `utils`, `common`, `services`, `models`).
- **Defaults are visible:** named `pub const`s with a doc comment giving units and source; no
  magic numbers. `Option<T>` means "absent", not a sentinel `0`.
- **Errors are explicit and future-proof:** `#[non_exhaustive]` `thiserror` enums with a
  per-variant doc comment stating when it fires (see `src/ref_seq.rs::RefSeqError`). Decide
  the error surface here — fallible constructor vs. fatal, `Result` vs. panic.
- **One swappable trait per step, impls side by side** (the bake-off shape) — but a step with
  no competing implementations is a single file with no trait ceremony. State which this is.
- **Reuse over rewrite.** New modules stand on existing code; the reconciliation table names
  what they build on. Prefer a single home for a shared contract so impls "cannot drift"
  (`ref_seq.rs::validate_window`).

## Ground every claim in the code — the reconciliation table most of all

The reconciliation table is the arch doc's highest-value section *and* its highest-risk one,
because every row is a claim about existing code: *this new name is that old type; reuse it; it has
this shape.* A wrong row sends the implementer to converge on a type that doesn't hold what you
said, and they discover it at the keyboard.

- **`file:line` for every row, and you actually looked.** A row you reason from memory is a row you
  guessed. If you can't cite it, open the file or cut the row.
- **Do not ship an "approximate, not re-read" row.** The existing `ng_step_interfaces.md` §6 marks
  some mappings `≈` "were not freshly re-read" — honest, but it is an ungrounded claim wearing a
  disclaimer, and the implementer still has to do the read you skipped. When you touch such a table,
  resolve the `≈`: read it, and either confirm the mapping or fix it.
- This is the same rule the spec skill states; in an arch doc it is not optional, because
  *converging on existing types* is the arch doc's core promise and the table is where it is kept.

## Decision records — the `— decided` form

Mirror `ng_step_interfaces.md` §5: **one decision per record**, each a bolded claim + one or two
sentences of *why*, ending with the spec cross-ref. Where a choice had a **genuine fork**, name the
rejected option and why it lost — but only where one was actually live. **Do not manufacture a
rejected alternative to make a record look considered**: a decision with no real fork is a
one-line statement of fact (`SsrLocus wraps the catalog Locus — spec §5`), not a staged contest.
The *why* here is usually a pointer, not a paragraph: the spec already argued it, so the record's
job is to carry the code shape plus a cross-ref, not to re-run the argument.

Open questions use `OPEN:` inline so a reader can grep the unresolved set. Distinguish a genuine
open *design* item from an impl-time confirmation (a concrete type to pin when coding) — the latter
is not a decision.

## Revision pass (before calling an arch doc done)

1. **Cut what the spec already says.** Go block by block: *code shape, or spec material re-typed?*
   Re-typed → replace with a cross-ref. If the doc is near its spec's length, you are duplicating.
2. **Every reconciliation row cited `file:line`, and you looked.** No `≈`-not-re-read rows survive.
   Did you check you are not minting a duplicate of an existing type?
3. Does every trait/type carry a **contract** (invariants, errors, laziness, ownership), not just a
   signature?
4. Do the **decision records** cross-ref the spec's *why* rather than re-argue it — and did you
   avoid manufacturing a rejected alternative where there was no real fork?
5. Are **naming, defaults, errors, module placement** all pinned per the code-shape discipline?
6. Are **open items** split into real open design questions (`OPEN:`) vs impl-time confirmations?
7. Run the **clear-technical-writing** pass (explanation before each code block; names say what
   the value is).
8. Is the doc **cross-linked** both ways with its spec, and discoverable from any index/README?

**The bar:** the coder builds from this doc + the spec without re-deciding anything and without
reconstructing a type or contract from prose; the plan author turns it straight into ordered steps.
Not "could this survive design review."

**When an arch doc gets sent back, the skill is half the fix.** As with its sibling
`spec-authoring`: ask what here permitted the failure, and mend it. These rules are this project's
scar tissue, not imported best practice.

## Sources & influences

- **Architecture Decision Records** (Nygard; MADR, adr.github.io) — the one-decision-per-record
  form, status, and *considered options with trade-offs*; the arch doc's decision records are
  ADRs embedded in the interface doc.
- **Google "Design Docs"** (industrialempathy.com) — sketch APIs and data storage without
  verbose copied schemas; keep detail out of the doc when it belongs in code review.
- The project's [`rust-code-review`](../rust-code-review/SKILL.md) category checklists
  (`naming`, `defaults`, `errors`, `module_structure`) and
  [`clear-technical-writing`](../clear-technical-writing/SKILL.md) — applied at design time so
  the conventions are locked in before code exists.
- Grounding examples: the repo's own `ng_step_interfaces.md`, `module_layout.md`,
  `arch/read_filtering.md`, and the code they describe (`src/`).
