//! - [`StreamingChromRefFetcher`] — per-contig, sliding-buffer reader.
//!   The workhorse for monotonic-forward access (cohort var-calling,
//!   PerGroupMerger). Implements the single-contig typed-error
//!   [`ChromRefFetcher`] trait. Bound to one contig at construction;
//!   serves `fetch(start, length)` and `iter_bases()` through a 1 MB
//!   sliding buffer.
//! - [`ManualEvictChromRefFetcher`] — per-contig, caller-managed
//!   buffer lifecycle. Designed for genuinely random-access patterns
//!   within a known region (Stage 1 BAQ per-worker instance).
//! - [`RepositoryRefFetcher`] — multi-contig fetcher used by the
//!   Stage 1 pileup walker. Reads windows out of the shared noodles
//!   `fasta::Repository` the reader already keeps resident (for CRAM
//!   decode and the per-read F1/F3 fetch), so the walker does not open a
//!   second reader over the same FASTA. Implements the multi-contig
//!   typed-error [`MultiChromRefFetcher`] trait; `Send + Sync` (holds

//!

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// New unified ChromRefFetcher API (in-flight migration).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The trait below is the single-contig typed-error fetcher API
// used by per-chrom consumers (DUST, PerGroupMerger). The
// multi-contig sibling is [`MultiChromRefFetcher`]
// (used by the Stage 1 walker). Both use [`ChromRefFetchError`].
//
// Design choices:
//
// - **No `chrom_id` parameter.** The fetcher is bound to one contig
//   at construction; multi-contig consumers build one fetcher per
//   contig rather than passing chrom ids per call.
// - **Typed error.** `ChromRefFetchError` distinguishes "I/O
//   failure", "out of contig bounds", and "out of access pattern"
//   so consumers can route them differently.
// - **`OutOfPattern` is the load-bearing contract.** A streaming
//   impl errors when a `fetch` start lies before the current sliding
//   buffer's origin. The contract is "monotonic non-decreasing
//   `start` across `fetch` calls within a phase"; `iter_bases()`
//   defines its own phase (resets the buffer state on construction
//   and on Drop). If the error fires in real code, that consumer
//   needs a random-access impl rather than a streaming one.
// - **`length()`** is exposed on the trait so consumers can use
//   the contig's declared length without threading it through
//   constructor calls.

/// Why a [`ChromRefFetcher`] call failed.
// M2 (2026-05-23 code review): #[non_exhaustive] so adding a future

// noodles `fasta::Repository` per run: the CRAM slice decoder needs it
// to reconstruct read bases, and the reader's per-read F1/F3
// reference-slice fetch (`fetch_ref_for_read`) pulls from it for BOTH
// CRAM and BAM input. The repository is a whole-contig cache, so by the
// time the walker processes a read, that read's contig is already
// resident.
//
// This fetcher lets the walker read its reference windows from that same
// resident sequence instead of opening a *second*, independent streaming
// reader over the same FASTA. It holds only an `Arc`-clone of the
// repository (no per-fetch state, no separate file handle, no extra
// bytes), so it is `Send + Sync` and adds zero memory beyond the
// repository the run already pays for. When the caller `clear()`s the
// repository on a contig transition, this fetcher transparently observes
// the cleared cache (it owns no `Arc<Sequence>` of its own).
//
// Byte-identity: the repository stores raw FASTA bytes (the reader's
// F1/F3 path slices them verbatim), so this fetcher applies the same
// [`canonicalise`] the streaming fetcher used — uppercase, non-ACGT → N
// — to return the exact bytes the walker expects.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// ManualEvictChromRefFetcher — caller-managed buffer lifecycle.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Designed for consumers whose access pattern is genuinely random
// access *within a known region* — Stage 1 BAQ is the motivating
// example. Each rayon worker owns its own instance via `map_init`
// and processes reads that may visit positions in any order within
// the current chunk's coord range. The worker calls `evict_before`
// at deterministic points to keep memory bounded.
//
// Contract:
//
// - `fetch(start, length)` returns a borrowed `&[u8]` slice. If the
//   range isn't covered, the buffer extends in whichever direction
//   is needed — forward by appending fresh bytes, backward by
//   prepending. Never shrinks on its own.
// - `evict_before(pos)` is the *only* shrinking operation. The
//   caller decides when bytes are no longer needed. CRAM is
//   coordinate-sorted, so calling `evict_before(read.pos)` after
//   each read keeps the buffer at "current-position window plus
//   whatever the next read extends forward."
//
// Trade-off vs [`StreamingChromRefFetcher`]:
//
// - Streaming forces monotonic forward access (small look-back
//   within the buffer is fine; large backward jumps are
//   `OutOfPattern`). Good for cohort var-calling.
// - ManualEvict tolerates any access pattern within the resident
//   range and trusts the caller to keep memory bounded. Good for
//   rayon-parallel random-access-within-chunk consumers. Worst case
//   (no `evict_before` calls + adversarial input) is one whole
//   contig resident — acceptable because the consumer controls it.
//
// Not `Sync`. Each thread holds its own instance; concurrent
// fetches from multiple threads on a single instance are forbidden.
// `Send` because every field is `Send`.
