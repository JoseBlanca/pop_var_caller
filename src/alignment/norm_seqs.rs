//! Shared sequence-normalization kernel — the representation-neutral core of
//! indel left-alignment, operating on raw byte sequences and index ranges.
//!
//! Given a set of parallel byte sequences (e.g. a reference allele and an
//! alternate allele, or a reference window and a read) and a half-open index
//! range into each marking the variant span, [`normalize_alleles`] trims shared
//! flanking bases for parsimony and shifts the spans as far left as the moved
//! bases stay equal across **all** sequences. That is the canonical
//! left-aligned, minimally-trimmed form `bcftools norm` / `vt normalize` / GATK
//! produce — the form GIAB truth uses, so identical variants consolidate onto
//! one allele instead of fragmenting across representations.
//!
//! This is a port of GATK `AlignmentUtils.normalizeAlleles`
//! (`gatk/.../utils/read/AlignmentUtils.java`), cross-checked against freebayes
//! `LeftAlign.cpp`. It is **representation-neutral**: it knows nothing about
//! CIGARs or alleles, only sequences and ranges. Two users build on it:
//!
//! - the SNP caller's CIGAR left-alignment ([`crate::alignment::indel_norm`])
//!   wraps it in a right-to-left CIGAR walk;
//! - the SSR caller's off-ladder path (Stage 1 `candidate_generation`) wraps it
//!   in a thin `(seqs, bounds)` adapter to canonicalize an off-ladder tract.
//!
//! Keeping one kernel means a fix to the subtle left-alignment logic reaches
//! both callers; a hand-rolled copy in either would be a divergence-bug farm.
//! See `doc/devel/implementation_plans/indel_normalization.md` and
//! `doc/devel/architecture/ssr_shared_types.md` §4.
//!
//! # ng's copy of `src/norm_seqs.rs`, and one line above is not yet true of it
//!
//! Copied on 2026-09-12 so that ng stops reaching into the tree being deleted. The body is
//! production's byte for byte; only the intra-doc link two paragraphs up was repointed.
//!
//! **The second of the two users named above does not exist in ng.** ng has no off-ladder
//! path built on this kernel — its repeat tracts are aligned by `alignment`'s own
//! algorithms — so today it has one caller, [`indel_norm`](super::indel_norm). The sentence
//! is kept rather than edited because it is production's and describes what the kernel was
//! shared for; this note is what says it describes production and not ng.

// without underflow; indices are always in-bounds when used to read bases.
