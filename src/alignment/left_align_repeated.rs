//! Algorithm 1b — **repeated simple passes**, freebayes' shape, an [`AlignmentNormalizer`].
//!
//! Where algorithm 1a ([`StructuredLeftAligner`](super::left_align_structured)) does the whole job
//! in one structured right-to-left walk, 1b takes freebayes' approach: run a **simple** shift pass,
//! and re-run it until nothing moves, bounded by a cap (freebayes uses 20,
//! `LeftAlign.h:118`). Implemented **from the description, not by transliterating** freebayes'
//! `LeftAlign.cpp` (spec §8), and deliberately kept independent of 1a and of production's
//! `left_align_indels` — it is a rival, so it may not lean on what it competes with.
//!
//! # What a "simple pass" is here
//!
//! One pass slides **every shiftable indel one base to the left** and stops. An indel can slide one
//! base left only across an aligned column that is a real **match**, with the base leaving the indel
//! on the left equal to the base entering from the right — the same definition the property oracle
//! grades against (spec §6), implemented here independently because a rival must not borrow the
//! oracle. Sliding a gap through a run therefore takes one pass per base, which is why the passes
//! are *repeated*; a pass that moves nothing is the fixed point.
//!
//! **A recorded consequence of "one base per pass".** freebayes slides each indel *maximally* per
//! pass, so its cap bounds the number of cross-indel re-slides. This one-base pass instead makes the
//! cap bound the total shift **distance**: an indel more than `max_passes` bases from its leftmost
//! home reports exhaustion where 1a would place it in a single pass. That is a real, deliberate
//! difference — it is exactly the kind of thing the differ-at-all screen (Milestone D) exists to
//! surface — and it makes the exhaustion path reachable and testable rather than only theoretical.
//!
//! **A second recorded difference from 1a: 1b does not trim a complex indel.** 1b canonicalizes its
//! output the way 1a does — merging same-kind gaps, ordering a deletion before an abutting insertion,
//! dropping zero-length ops — so on a *pure* indel (the common case, and essentially all real reads)
//! it produces exactly 1a's spelling. It does **not**, however, trim a deletion/insertion overlap
//! whose bases cancel (`D2 I1` → `D1`), which 1a inherits from `normalize_alleles`. So for a complex
//! indel the two can differ in more than placement. Both remain leftmost (the property oracle grades
//! placement, not parsimony); the difference is left un-eliminated deliberately — trimming is a
//! separate normalization axis this "simple repeated shift" step does not own, and the screen
//! surfaces the difference rather than hiding it. **Recorded for the owner at Checkpoint C**: whether
//! 1b should also trim, for full parity with 1a, is a scope call, not a silent omission.
//!
//! # Exhaustion is reported, not swallowed
//!
//! freebayes computes a convergence flag and its own caller ignores it, so non-convergent results
//! ship silently (spec §6). Here the flag is the **return value** of [`RepeatedLeftAligner::left_align`]
//! ([`ConvergenceReport`]): a caller cannot drop it by accident. The [`AlignmentNormalizer`] trait's
//! `normalize` is a uniform interface that cannot carry a report, so it discards it *visibly* — but
//! the reporting method is the real API, and it is what the tests and the screen use. (Algorithm 1c
//! makes the opposite choice on the cap: it **panics** rather than returning a half-normalised
//! alignment.)
