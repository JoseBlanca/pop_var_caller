//! Algorithm 6 — the whole-read forward.
//!
//! Scores the **whole read** against a **full flank-repeat-flank** reference in one forward
//! pass, summed over every line-up, returned as a [`LogProb`]. This is the alternative to
//! algorithm 5 ([`ssr_marginal_sequence`](super::ssr_marginal_sequence)): where algorithm 5
//! scores an already-*measured* repeat against a candidate, this scores the read verbatim and
//! **marginalizes the repeat length itself**, so it inherits no delimitation and carries
//! forward no mistake a ruler might have made (spec §9). It has **no production counterpart** —
//! it is new code (arch §5) — built here to settle whether the whole-read design wins before
//! anyone pays for the per-read storage it would otherwise require. The head-to-head against
//! algorithm 5 is **not** in this module; it spans the genotyping that composes it (spec
//! §10.3). This file only proves the algorithm computes what it claims.
//!
//! ## A two-regime forward, reusing the delimiter's model
//!
//! It is the **sum-reduction analog of the tract delimiter** (algorithm 3): the same two gap
//! regimes — a **stiff** gap in the flanks and a **soft** gap inside the tract — but summed
//! over all line-ups (a forward), not maximised with a traceback (Viterbi). The two regimes
//! are what make it repeat-aware and what let a read score highest against **its own** allele:
//! the flanks anchor (stiff gaps hold the junctions), while the tract is free to change length
//! (soft gaps), so a read whose repeat is *k* units aligns cheaply to a *k*-unit reference and
//! dearly to any other. **This is the opposite of algorithm 5's rule:** algorithm 5 *forbids*
//! interior gaps (they are the stutter model's to explain); algorithm 6 *permits* soft tract
//! gaps precisely so it can marginalize the length without a prior measurement.
//!
//! Reuse, not rewrite (arch §5):
//!
//! - **Transitions** — production's [`TransitionCosts`], the exact two-regime gap model
//!   algorithm 3 uses (and algorithm 4 shares), read through its accessors. So algorithm 6
//!   inherits algorithm 3's *provisional* gap-open calibration verbatim — including the known
//!   match→match inconsistency, which computes `ln_match_to_match` from the flank open and
//!   never recomputes it under the tract regime (spec §4.2). Reproduced knowingly by reuse,
//!   not re-derived.
//! - **Emission** — the module's log-space [`FlatEmission`]. Algorithm 6 scores with **one
//!   flat error rate and a fixed synthetic quality** (spec §9): the flat emission ignores
//!   per-base quality, so every base is scored as if it carried one synthetic quality. That is
//!   the whole point — no real per-read quality is read or stored, which keeps the per-locus
//!   observation table a tally rather than per-read records. (Unlike algorithm 5, which needed
//!   a *linear* representation for byte-parity against `align_subst`, algorithm 6 has no parity
//!   oracle and runs in **log space**, so it reuses the log-space component directly — the
//!   "reuse the Emission component" the plan's preconditions asked for.)
//!
//! ## Log space, and unbanded
//!
//! The forward runs in **log probabilities** with a stable log-sum-exp, so the result is a
//! [`LogProb`] with no separate conversion step: a whole read is longer than a repeat, and log
//! space keeps it from underflowing however long the read (spec §7). It fills the **full**
//! `(m+1)×(n+1)` matrix for each of the three states — **unbanded**, matching how algorithm 3
//! first shipped: correctness before the banding optimisation, which is a later, separately
//! proved change (spec §5, §10.3).
