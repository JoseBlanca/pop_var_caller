//! Open-record formation, merging, and widening — the

//! §"Open-record formation and merging".

//! An open record is the in-flight version of a `PileupRecord`:
//! same shape, but its REF span and allele list grow as the walker
//! folds events into it. When the walker confirms no future event
//! can touch the record (its footprint is fully behind the walker
//! per the closure rule), it converts the open record into a
//! finalised `PileupRecord` and pushes it through the channel.
