//! Lazy CIGAR cursor — emits per-position events on demand from a
//! `PreparedRead`'s CIGAR. Replaces the eager `Vec<ReadEvent>` per
//! active read and the per-walker-step clones that drove the
//! super-linear scaling measured in
//! [`benches/pileup_walker_scaling.rs`](../../../benches/pileup_walker_scaling.rs).
//!
//! The cursor holds only an offset table — one entry per CIGAR
//! op. Every event-fetching call takes the read back as a
//! parameter, so the cursor stays a small self-contained struct
//! with no borrow on the read's buffers.
//!
//! Two query shapes:
//!
//! - `events_at(walker_pos, read)`: events whose **anchor** is
//!   `walker_pos`. The walker uses this once per step to identify
//!   contributing reads.
//! - `events_overlapping(lo, hi, read)`: events whose **footprint**
//!   intersects `[lo, hi)`. The open-record fold uses this to
//!   compute the haplotype string a read presents under a given
//!   record's footprint.
//!
//! The two are deliberately not equivalent — a deletion anchored
//! before the window whose deleted run reaches into it overlaps
//! the window but is not anchored at any position inside.
//!
//! Two implementation strategies, selected automatically at
//! construction based on the CIGAR's op count:
//!
//! - **Linear** (default for ≤ `BINARY_SEARCH_OP_THRESHOLD` ops):
//!   walk all ops left-to-right with an early break once we pass
//!   the query window. Constant per-call setup; cheap when only
//!   a handful of ops exist (typical Illumina with 1–5 ops).
//! - **Binary search** (for > `BINARY_SEARCH_OP_THRESHOLD` ops):
//!   `partition_point` the offset table to skip the prefix of
//!   ops that can't contribute, then walk forward. Pays a small
//!   fixed setup cost per call, amortised by skipping tens or
//!   hundreds of ops on long reads with many small indels.
//!
//! The crossover is empirical — see the bench discussion in
//! `ia/feature_implementation_plans/pileup_lazy_cigar.md` and
//! the implementation report. Auto-selection keeps the choice
//! internal to the cursor so callers don't need to reason about
//! it.
//!
//! Equivalence with the (now test-only) `decompose` reference is
//! asserted by the parity oracle in this module's test submodule
//! — both modes are exercised against the same corpus.
