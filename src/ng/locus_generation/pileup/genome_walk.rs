//! The walker loop. Single-threaded; drives all the building
//! blocks (active set, chain-id allocator, open-record table) through
//! the closure rule and yields finalised `PileupRecord`s through
//! a pull-shaped `Iterator`.
//!
//! The walker is a state machine: each call to `Iterator::next()`
//! advances it until at least one record is ready (or end-of-input
//! is reached), then yields one record at a time. A single walker
//! tick may emit 0, 1, or many records; the iterator buffers them
//! in a small `VecDeque` and drains across successive `next()`
