//! Phase-chain identifier allocator: hands out a fresh, never-reused
//! `u64` to each read (or read pair).
//!
//! See `ia/specs/phase_chain.md`. One read (or one read pair, with
//! mates collapsed via `pending_mates`) gets one identifier. The
//! identifier space is per-`.psp` file, monotonically allocated from
//! zero, and never recycled. Overflow at `u64::MAX + 1` is caught and
//! surfaced as [`WalkerError::ChainIdSpaceExhausted`] — see
//! `ia/feature_implementation_plans/unique_chain_ids.md` §"Overflow
//! guard".
//!
//! With unique ids there is no chain lifecycle to track downstream:
//! the per-record new/expired chain markers and the writer-side
//! active-set bookkeeping are gone. The allocator's remaining
//! responsibilities are (a) minting the id, (b) collapsing a read
//! pair onto one id via the `pending_mates` map, and (c) defending
//! against pathological depth via the `max_active_reads` cap that
//! lives on the walker side.
//!
//! The cap on *concurrent active reads* (`WalkerConfig::max_active_reads`)
//! is enforced here as a defensive check: if the number of active reads
//! ever exceeds the cap, [`WalkerError::ActiveReadsExhausted`] surfaces.
//! The cap is independent of, and far smaller than, the `u64`
//! identifier space.
//!
//! # ng's, from the depth-cap change of 2026-08-05 — released from `copy_fidelity.rs`
//!
//! This file was byte-for-byte production's until the owner lifted the pin
//! (*"You might copy any file from production and then change it. ng is destined to
//! replace production in the near future."*). Two constants moved and one counter
//! is new; nothing else here is ng's.
//!
//! - [`DEFAULT_MAX_ACTIVE_READS`] rose from 4,096 to 32,768. At 4,096 the walk was
//!   **refusing reads at the door** on ordinary whole-genome data — 19,725 of
//!   113,629,764 on one tomato chromosome — which left positions covered by fewer
//!   reads than the BAM had for them. That is the behaviour the owner called wrong.
//! - [`MAX_PENDING_MATES`] rose from 10,000 to 1,000,000, because at 4,096 held reads
//!   the old value could not be reached and at 32,768 it can. It is still a defence
//!   against a malformed BAM, just one sized for the walk that now exists.
//! - [`ChainIdAllocatorCounters::pending_mates_high_water`] is new, so the headroom
//!   above is a measured number rather than an assumed one.
