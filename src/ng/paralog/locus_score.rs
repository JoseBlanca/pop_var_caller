//! The per-locus hidden-paralog scoring function (Q3).
//!
//! [`score_locus_for_paralogy`] asks, at one locus, which of two stories
//! better explains all the samples' coverage and allele counts:
//!
//! - **H1 — a real, single-copy variant.** The allele frequency `p` is
//!   marginalised under the folded site-frequency-spectrum prior
//!   `∝ 1/(p(1−p))` on `[1/2N, 1−1/2N]`; per sample the genotype prior is the
//!   Wright inbreeding-adjusted HWE with the sample's `F`, the allele factor
//!   is binomial over `vaf ∈ {ε, ½, 1−ε}`, and coverage is `~ Normal(1, σ₀)`
//!   *independent of genotype*.
//! - **H2 — a hidden (reference-collapsed) paralog.** Per carrier
//!   configuration `(T, m)` (total copies `T ∈ {3,4,6,8}`, keeping only the
//!   single-PSV `m = 1` and balanced `m ≈ T/2`), a carrier has coverage
//!   `~ Normal(T/2, σ₀·√(T/2))` and `vaf = m/T < 1`; a non-carrier is
//!   single-copy REF. Carrier vs non-carrier follows the Wright dosage HWE in
//!   the carrier frequency `q`, marginalised over `configuration × q`.
//!
//! The result is `paralog_log_likelihood_ratio = logL(H2) − logL(H1)`, a
//! **pure** likelihood ratio (nothing added — MQDiff is shared with
//! introgression and stays a VCF INFO field, spec §2–§3), so the prior/FDR
//! step (Q5) can treat it as a Bayes factor. Both hypotheses are *marginal*
//! (log-sum-exp over their grids, not maximised — averaging charges each
//! hypothesis for its flexibility). Because every H2 carrier has `vaf < 1`, a
//! confidently hom-alt sample is near-impossible under H2 — the hom-alt veto
//! falls out for free.
//!
//! Faithful to the prototype `benchmarks/tomato2/src/build_paralog_lr.py`,
//! with the production divergences settled in arch Premise 2 / spec §5:
//! per-sample σ₀ (from each sample's [`SingleCopyCoverageModel`]), the
//! folded-SFS `p` prior, and MQDiff excluded from the score.
//!
//! [`SingleCopyCoverageModel`]: crate::ng::paralog::SingleCopyCoverageModel
//!
//! ---
//!
//! **ng's copy, released from the textual guard on 2026-09-09.** Everything above and below
//! this note began as `src/paralog/locus_score.rs`, line for line and byte for byte, and
//! **one function no longer is**: [`log_add_exp`] skips its `log1p` where the series of
//! `ln(1 + x)` is already exact in the sum it goes into. `log1p` was 52.6% of the
//! hidden-duplication filter's scoring pass and that pass was 31% of a `call-from-psps` run.
//! `copy_fidelity.rs` no longer guards this file and its release table says so; **what
//! replaced the textual guarantee is the numeric one**, below. The model's constants are the
//! tomato2 prototype's, inherited and **not re-measured**
//! (`doc/devel/ng/spec/hidden_paralog_filter.md` §3.2, plan step A2).
//!
//! **Nothing else here may drift, and the release does not license it to.** A second departure
//! wants the same treatment this one got: a reason that is a measurement, a bound derived from
//! the arithmetic rather than from a sweep, and the differential below re-read afterwards.
//!
//! **What proves the copy computes what it was copied from is not this file's tests.**
//! They are production's, transcribed, so they pass on both trees whatever either does.
//! `production_parity.rs` feeds the two implementations the same randomised inputs — at
//! cohort sizes 1, 2, 10 and 63, with absent samples, zero-read samples and degenerate σ₀
//! among them — and asserts the two counts equal exactly and the likelihood ratio and both
//! log-likelihoods **within 1e-9 nats**, a wall derived from the series' truncation term.
//! **The gap it measures is exactly zero**, so on everything that differential draws the two
//! trees still return the same `f64`. **One sample is in that set deliberately** (spec §4): the
//! folded site-frequency-spectrum grid degenerates to a single point at `N = 1`, and
//! nothing had exercised the copied precompute there.
