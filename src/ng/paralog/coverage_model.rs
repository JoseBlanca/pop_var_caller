//! The per-sample single-copy coverage model (Q2).
//!
//! Answers "at a window of this GC content, what read depth would *one
//! copy* produce in this sample?" by fitting three quantities from the
//! sample's stored [`CoverageByGcHistogram`]:
//!
//! - `single_copy_scale` — the sample's typical one-copy depth level, taken
//!   as the **global mode** of the covered-window depth distribution (arch
//!   Premise 1: the mode marks the one-copy peak without assuming
//!   single-copy windows are an outright majority, as the prototype's median
//!   does). A `mode/median ∉ [0.5, 1.5]` sanity guard rejects the fit when
//!   the mode landed on a wrong copy-number peak.
//! - `gc_bias_curve` — a per-GC multiplier, the weighted median of the
//!   relative depth over the single-copy band, gap-filled and smoothed.
//! - `single_copy_depth_sd` (σ₀) — the robust spread (`1.4826·MAD`) of a
//!   one-copy window's relative depth, fit from the data (≈ 0.28 on
//!   tomato2), feeding the Normal coverage term of the H1/H2 likelihood.
//!
//! Their product `single_copy_scale · gc_bias_curve(GC)` is the expected
//! single-copy depth; dividing an observed window depth by it gives the
//! **relative copy number** (`1.0 = one copy`). The `(GC, depth)` at a
//! locus is measured fresh from the `.psp` body at scoring time — the
//! histogram is only the training data.
//!
//! Faithful in mechanism to the prototype
//! `benchmarks/tomato2/src/build_gc_normalization.py`, adapted to fit from
//! the binned 2-D histogram rather than the raw per-window table, and to
//! anchor on the mode rather than the median (arch Premise 1, spec §4).
//!
//! ---
//!
//! **ng's copy.** Everything above and below this note is line for line and byte for byte
//! `src/paralog/coverage_model.rs`, which `copy_fidelity.rs` asserts textually — ng
//! appends this note to production's header and changes nothing else. The constants and
//! guards are the tomato2 prototype's, inherited and **not re-measured**
//! (`doc/devel/ng/spec/hidden_paralog_filter.md` §3.1, plan step A1).
//!
//! **The histogram it fits from is ng's own** ([`crate::ng::window_coverage`]), where
//! production's reads `crate::sample_summary`. That one-line difference is declared to the
//! copy guard as an *input type ng owns* — the port exists so that ng's filter does not
//! depend on the frozen tree, and a copy that kept production's path would have tied it there
//! for good.
//!
//! **The fit needed nothing else.** It reads five of the histogram's fields — `window_bp`,
//! `gc_bins`, `depth_bin_width`, `depth_bins`, `counts` — and ng's histogram carries all five
//! under the same names. The three that differ (production's `n_positions` and
//! `n_skipped_tiles` are ng's `windows_folded` and `windows_under_the_floor`, and
//! `callable_positions` has no counterpart) are read by no line of the fit.
//!
//! **The transcribed tests below are outside the guard, and only they are.** Production's
//! fixture builds the histogram naming all eight of its fields; ng's names the six it has, and
//! three lines becoming two is not a substitution any line-for-line repoint can express. So the
//! guard's span stops at `#[cfg(test)]` and the 644 lines above it — the whole of the fit —
//! stay compared byte for byte.
