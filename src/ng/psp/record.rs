//! One record's head: the fixed fields at the front of every record that let a reader
//! decide whether it wants the record without building it.
//!
//! ```text
//! record = position_offset | reference_span | non_reference_reads | body_bytes
//!          | chain_id_changes | body
//!          └──────────────────────── the head ─────────────────────┘   └─ skip ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! **[`RecordHead`] is the fixed part of that head, and only the fixed part.** The chain-id
//! live-set changes — which reads arrived at this position and which left — are in the head
//! too, because they carry state a skipping reader must keep up to date or the merge composes
//! an allele for a read that was never there (spec psp_record_encoding.md §6). They are a
//! variable-length list, 6.42 bytes a position at 293 reads a position, so they are handed
//! straight to the reader's live set rather than stored in a `Copy` struct. Milestone E3 is
//! where they land; nothing in this type has to change for them.
//!
//! A reader takes the head, decides, and either builds the body or advances `body_bytes`
//! past it; nothing else in the block has to be touched to make that decision. **Measured
//! on a tomato accession at three reads a position, 7.69 M records: a walk keeping one
//! record in a hundred takes 0.141 s against 0.29 s for one that builds every record —
//! 2.06× faster** (spec §4.3).
//!
//! **The head is not free, and most of its price is not the length field.** It costs 9.2 %
//! of the file at three reads a position and 5.8 % at 279, of which the length field alone
//! is 1.4 % and 3.3 %. The rest is what skippability forces on the body: a record's
//! coverage and its chain ids would otherwise be coded as differences from the previous
//! record, and a reader that skips a body never sees those differences — so both restart at
//! every record instead (spec §4.3).
