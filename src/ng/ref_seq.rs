//! Reference-sequence access — the [`RefSeq`] trait and its implementations. The shared
//! source of reference-genome bases for the pileup, BAQ, DUST, left-alignment, and read
//! filtering. Design spec: `doc/devel/ng/spec/ref_seq.md`.
//!
//! [`RefSeq`] is the **universal** surface: canonical `{A,C,G,T,N}` fetch, which every
//! implementation provides. The rest are capabilities a consumer can *require*: raw bytes
//! ([`RawRefSeq`]), the contig table ([`ContigTable`]), and releasing what a forward walk
//! has passed ([`EvictableRefSeq`]). The last two were inherent methods on
//! [`WindowedRefSeq`] until the typed-region walk needed to demand them of a reference
//! rather than assume them of one impl. Both fetch surfaces write
//! into a caller-owned buffer (`&self`, alloc-free when the buffer is reused) rather than
//! returning a borrowed slice — that keeps every impl `&self`-shareable and avoids the
//! lazy-load/borrow-escape problem the file-backed impls would otherwise hit.
//!
//! This file holds the traits, the error type, and all three implementations: the
//! synthetic [`InMemoryRefSeq`], the whole-contig FASTA-backed [`ResidentRefSeq`], and the
//! streaming, caller-evictable [`WindowedRefSeq`]. Canonicalisation reuses the production
//! [`crate::fasta::fetcher::canonicalise`], so canonical bytes are byte-identical to the
//! production fetchers by construction.
//!
//! `noodles`' FASTA crate is referred to by its full name `noodles_fasta` here (only the
//! `Repository` type is named); `crate::fasta` is our own module. Keeping the two spelled
//! differently avoids the "same token, two crates" ambiguity.
