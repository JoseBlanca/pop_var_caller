//! ng's STR **segment criteria** — which detected tandem repeats become an STR
//! segment (an [`SsrSegment`], or a bundle member), and which are rejected.
//!
//! **A segment, not a locus.** [`classify`] returns physical typings, not genetic
//! markers: an [`SsrSegment`] is a stretch of DNA carrying a tandem repeat, and it
//! becomes a *locus* only if it turns out to be variable — which is a downstream
//! decision, not this module's. The word "criteria" is deliberate: these are the
//! tests a detected repeat passes to be *typed* as an STR segment, not a policy for
//! routing it to a caller (owner, 2026-07-18).
//!
//! **This began as a port of [`crate::ssr::catalog::postprocess`], not a rewrite.**
//! The rule set (period scope, score gate, compound-motif drop, bundle drop,
//! minimal trim, copy floor, purity floor, contig-edge drop) is a working, tested
//! implementation — itself a faithful port of GangSTR's `minimal_trim.py` /
//! `remove_bundles.py` — and re-deriving it would be daft (spec §5). So the
//! **decisions are transcribed unchanged**; the shape is ng's.
//!
//! **One rule is deliberately not ported: the flank embed.** Production's
//! `build_loci` stores each tract's bases plus a flank each side, because its
//! consumer genotypes loci without a FASTA open. This module's job is to say what
//! each stretch of the genome *is*, and a payload nobody here reads is not part of
//! that (owner, 2026-07-17 — see [`SsrSegment`]). The **flank requirement stays**: a
//! tract without clean sequence either side is not an STR, which is a question
//! about distances, not bases.
//!
//! ## Why a copy and not a call
//!
//! Step 3 needs classification windowed, 1-based/`u64`, `RepeatInterval`-driven,
//! all-knobs, and handing bundle members back rather than dropping them. That is
//! five changes to `build_loci`, which is not "a small tweak" — and production is
//! frozen (spec Revision 2026-07-16, owner): `src/ssr/` stays exactly as it is,
//! so it remains an **independent yardstick** for the experiments ng exists to
//! run. A production catalog we had rebased to suit ng would be a mirror, not an
//! oracle.
//!
//! The cost is two copies of one policy, which can silently diverge. The
//! mitigation is that divergence is **tested for** rather than prevented:
//! the `differential_vs_production_build_loci_*` tests below drive both
//! implementations from the same intervals and assert identical loci (spec
//! §8.0). What sharing one function used to guarantee by construction is now a
//! test — a weaker guarantee, and the price of a production tree an experiment
//! cannot break.
//!
//! **The differential's blind spot, stated because it is not obvious.** Both
//! sides run the *same* inputs through *transcribed* logic, so an input class no
//! test supplies is not merely uncovered — it is **invisible**: both
//! implementations would be wrong together and the test would stay green. That is
//! why the suite deliberately drives the gates that a single fixed configuration
//! never fires (`min_score`, `min_purity`), a tract `minimal_trim` actually trims,
//! and soft-masked sequence. Each was verified by mutation: break the code, the
//! test fails.
//!
//! ## Divergences from production, and they are the whole list
//!
//! 1. **Coordinates are 1-based inclusive** ([`SsrSegment`]), where production's are
//!    0-based half-open (spec §4). ng is 1-based end to end; production is not
//!    asked to move.
//! 2. **`u64`** coordinates and lengths, where production is `u32` (spec §4).
//! 3. **Input is [`RepeatInterval`]** (ng's scanner) rather than `TrfRecord`
//!    (trf-mod's parse shape). `build_loci` only ever reads `start`/`end`/
//!    `period`/`score` — exactly `RepeatInterval`'s fields — so this costs
//!    nothing. **ng does not depend on trf-mod** (spec Revision).
//! 4. **The pre-filter lives here**, beside the policy it is inseparable from,
//!    rather than in a test file (spec §5.1).
//! 5. **[`Motif`] is ng's too**, against spec §4's expectation — see below.
//!
//! Milestone A2 adds the knobs (period scope, copy floors) and A3 the windowing;
//! both keep the differential green. **Nothing else differs on purpose** — and
//! anything that differs by accident is what the differential exists to catch.
//!
//! ## Order (unchanged from production; `postprocess`'s own numbering)
//!
//! 1. **Period 2..=6** + an early `score` floor. Period-1 homopolymers are
//!    dropped before bundling, so a poly-A run cannot bundle-drop a real STR.
//! 2. **Drop compound-motif loci** — a motif itself internally periodic
//!    (`ATAT` = `(AT)²`).
//! 3. **Drop bundles** — any repeat within `bundle_threshold` of another goes
//!    with its whole cluster. (ng keeps the *selection* and rejects the
//!    *disposal* in A3 — spec §2.4 — but A1 transcribes it as-is.)
//! 4. **End-trim** to whole-motif boundaries, then the per-period copy floor.
//! 5. **Recompute purity** from the trimmed tract, then the purity floor.
//! 6. **The flank check**: clamp `tract ± bundle_threshold` at the *contig's* ends and drop
//!    any locus whose flank clamped to zero — a tract with no anchor. Arithmetic
//!    only; production embeds the bases here, and ng does not (above).

// The candidate — retired at B2
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A1 introduced a private `Candidate` — "exactly the four fields `build_loci`
// reads off a `TrfRecord`, widened to ng's `u64`" — because `RepeatInterval` was
// `u32` and the port needed one widening site rather than a `u64::from` scattered
// through the policy. Its doc said B2 would make the conversion an identity but
// that the type would "still earn its keep as the 'what classification actually needs'
// statement".
//
// **It did not.** With `RepeatInterval` at `u64` (spec §4), `Candidate` was
// field-for-field identical to it, reachable only through two `From` impls that
// were both no-ops — and one of them carried a `try_into().expect()` and a
// `fallible_impl_from` exemption for a narrowing that can no longer narrow. That
// is ceremony asserting a distinction the types no longer have, so the policy now
// works on `RepeatInterval` directly. `Classified::bundled` hands the caller's own
// intervals back with no conversion at all, which is what "handed back verbatim"
// should have meant all along.
//
// **Coordinates are 0-based half-open throughout the policy** — the detector's and
// the slice's own space. The conversion to ng's 1-based inclusive happens exactly
// once, at [`SsrSegment`] construction in [`finish_locus`], which is the one place the
// arithmetic does not cancel (spec §4).

// The pre-filter
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Clean raw scanner intervals before [`classify`] — **not optional** (spec §5b).
///
/// A validated finding, not a guess (`scanner_parity`, Milestone D of the
/// scanner plan). trf-mod hands `build_loci` a *clean* candidate set:
/// statistically significant repeats, redundancy already eliminated. Our scanner
/// is deliberately permissive (`min_copies = 2`), so it also emits low-copy noise
/// in aperiodic sequence **and every period-multiple of every real tract**. Fed
/// straight in, that noise trips the bundle drop — which runs *before* the copy
/// floor — and cascades the real loci away (the first parity run scored 0/16).
/// With this filter the scanner reproduces the golden catalog at **16/16**.
///
/// Two cleanups, mirroring what trf-mod bakes in: the per-period **copy floor**,
/// then **period-multiple redundancy elimination** (trf-mod's `IsRedundant` — a
/// higher-period interval overlapping a divisor-period one is the same tract).
///
/// Ported from the test-only `catalog_prefilter`
/// (`ng::scanner_parity` — `#[cfg(test)]`, so not linkable), which had no
/// production home; here it sits
/// beside the policy whose ordering makes it necessary (spec §5.1).
///
/// **It reads the same [`MinCopies`] as [`classify`] — since A2, there is one
/// table.** A1 carried production's two copies verbatim (see
/// [`MinCopies`]); folding them is what makes a swept floor actually move
/// the whole policy, rather than half of it. `p.periods.min()` likewise replaces
/// the bare `2` this was ported with.
///
/// **The period *ceiling* is deliberately not applied here — only the floor is —
/// and the reason is transcription fidelity, nothing cleverer.** Production's
/// pre-filter gates `period >= 2` and leaves the ceiling to `build_loci`, so this
/// does the same. Since no test can compare it (above), matching the original by
/// inspection is the whole of the evidence, and staying close to it is the point.
///
/// *Two arguments an earlier draft gave here were wrong, recorded so they are not
/// re-invented: (1) that applying the ceiling early "would change which survivors
/// eliminate which" — it cannot, because `floored` sorts ascending by period, so
/// an out-of-scope interval only ever sorts after in-scope ones and can only be a
/// victim of redundancy elimination, never an eliminator; every interval it could
/// eliminate is its own multiple, which [`classify`]'s ceiling drops regardless. And
/// (2) that "the differential would catch it otherwise" — it cannot, and the
/// paragraph above says so.*
///
/// **The two floors run at different points, and that is the whole of this
/// function's subtlety** (fixed 2026-07-17; see
/// `a_homopolymer_does_not_survive_as_a_period_two_repeat`). The **copy** floor runs
/// first, the **period** floor runs *last* — after redundancy elimination — because
/// **period 1 divides every period**, which cuts both ways:
///
/// - A homopolymer tiles under every motif length: `AAAA…` is a perfect period-2
///   `AA`, period-3 `AAA`, period-5 `AAAAA` repeat, and the scanner emits all of
///   them. Only the period-1 interval can eliminate those aliases. Drop period 1
///   *before* redundancy — as this did until 2026-07-17 — and the aliases outlive
///   their only eliminator: a 30 bp poly-A came out as **three** "repeats" (periods
///   2, 3 and 5, identical spans), which then fed coverage, the satellite cap and
///   the rejection counts as if three tandem repeats were there. **The period floor
///   filtered out the period-1 *label*, not the homopolymer**, so
///   `periods.min() == 2` did not mean what it said.
/// - The reason it was ordered that way is real, and the **copy** floor is what
///   answers it: a surviving period-1 interval eliminates every real STR it
///   overlaps. Aperiodic sequence is full of 2 bp period-1 specks (`GG`, `TT`), and
///   those must never be eliminators. [`MinCopies`]'s period-1 entry is **10** — so
///   they are dropped here, by the copy floor, and only a genuine homopolymer run
///   survives to eliminate its own aliases. That entry was dead weight until this
///   ordering (nothing reached it — see
///   `the_two_copy_floor_tables_agree_on_every_reachable_period`); it is now exactly
///   what separates a poly-A from a speck.
///
/// **The scanner must therefore scan period 1 even when nothing classifies it**
/// (`TypedRegionConfig::periods`, which is why it is a separate knob from
/// `SsrSegmentCriteria::periods`): an eliminator that was never detected cannot
/// eliminate. Not seeing a homopolymer and dropping one are *not* the same, and
/// this ordering is what makes that sentence true.
///
/// The result is that **the period range means what it says**: at `2..=6` a
/// homopolymer contributes nothing at all, and at `1..=6` it is classified as a
/// period-1 tract under its own motif. Which of those is wanted is the caller's
/// parameter, not this function's opinion.
///
/// **Malformed intervals are dropped, not trusted.** `RepeatInterval`'s fields are
/// `pub` and carry no ordering invariant, and this fn is `pub` — unlike the
/// private `#[cfg(test)]` helper it was ported from, which only ever saw its own
/// scanner's output. An `end < start` interval would underflow `end - start`:
/// debug panic, or release wrap-to-huge — and a wrapped copy count sails straight
/// through the very floor this filter exists to apply. So the ordering is checked

    /// - **`Purity` — unreachable, and this is the interesting one.** Not because of the
    ///   pre-filter, but because of **Ruzzo–Tompa**: the scanner emits *maximal-scoring*
    ///   segments, and a tract impure enough to fail the 0.80 floor always contains a purer
    ///   sub-segment that scores higher — so the scanner emits *that*, and classification is
    ///   handed the pure core. Measured: a 0.79-purity fixture comes back a **locus**.
    ///   E1e argued from the two thresholds (scanner ≈0.78 vs classification 0.80) that tracts
    ///   would land in the gap; they cannot, because the segmenter never hands the gap over.
    /// - **`NoCleanTrim` — unreachable**, for the same reason: a tract with no motif pair
    ///   in its trim window is a tract the scanner segments away first.
    /// - **`Compound` — unreachable, since 2026-07-17.** E1e's *reasoning* was right all
    ///   along — a compound motif is a period-multiple, and redundancy elimination drops it
    ///   (`ATAT` is eliminated by `AT`) — but it was **false of period 1**, which
    ///   `prefilter` used to drop by the period floor *before* it could eliminate anything.
    ///   That let a poly-A's period-2 alias reach `classify` as motif `AA`, and made this the
    ///   homopolymer gate. The ordering fix gives period 1 its eliminating pass, so the
