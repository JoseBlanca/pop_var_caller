//! ng step 3 — the typed-region generator: walk the reference and cut it into
//! consecutive typed regions, each a span plus *what the sequence there is*.
//! Design: `doc/devel/ng/spec/typed_regions.md` (spec) and
//! `doc/devel/ng/arch/typed_regions.md` (types & interfaces).
//!
//! **Build status (incremental).** [`segment_criteria`] — ng's own copy of the STR
//! classification policy (Milestone A) — plus the walk's types: [`TypedRegion`],
//! [`RegionKind`], [`TypedRegionConfig`], [`TypedRegionCounts`],
//! [`TypedRegionError`] (C2). `GenomeRegions` (C3) and `TypedRegionIterator` plus
//! the walk itself (D–E) are still to come, so **nothing here has logic yet** —
//! these are the shapes the walk will fill.
//!
//! **A folder, not a file, and not because of a bake-off** (there is none —
//! spec §6). The classification port is a second concern with its own dense test
//! suite, so it gets its own module beside the walk.
//!
//! ## Production is frozen; ng owns its copies
//!
//! Step 3 needs an STR classification policy that is windowed, 1-based/`u64`,
//! driven by `RepeatInterval`s, all-knobs, and that hands bundle members back
//! instead of dropping them. `ssr::catalog::postprocess::build_loci` is none of
//! those things, and **reshaping it in place is not on the table** (spec
//! Revision 2026-07-16, owner): production stays exactly as it is, so that it
//! remains an *independent yardstick* for the experiments ng exists to run.
//!
//! So [`segment_criteria`] is a **port**: the logic transcribed unchanged, the shape
//! ng's. What sharing one function used to guarantee for free, a test now pins
//! — see [`segment_criteria`]'s differential against production (spec §8.0).

/// already parses BED, coalesces overlapping and adjacent spans, clamps to contig
/// lengths, resolves names against the contig table, and drops zero-length
/// contigs — and it is the same code the production caller's `--regions` runs, so
/// ng and production agree on what a BED *means* by construction rather than by
/// coincidence. `src/regions.rs` is not edited (spec Revision): this wrapper adds
/// ng's width and ng's names, and nothing else.
///
/// **A user BED is not a special case**, which `regions.rs` settled first: *"'Whole
/// genome' is not a special case — it is the region set whose every region covers
/// an entire contig."* [`Self::whole_contigs`] is the default, not a bypass.
///
/// ## The conversion this owns — and it is smaller than the spec expected
///
/// Spec §4 called this "the one conversion seam", *"`GenomeRegions` widening (and
/// **rebasing**) `RegionSet`'s `u32`"*. **There is no rebasing.** `regions::Region`
/// is already **1-based inclusive** — its own doc says so, and its invariant is
/// `1 <= start <= end`. So production and ng already agree on the base, and the
/// only conversion here is `u32` → `u64`, which is lossless and infallible.

/// bare locus reaches here when it does *not*: a satellite run is built from **cleaned
/// coverage**, while bundling only ever sees tracts that cleared the scope/score/compound
/// gates — so an array rejected by one of those still forms a satellite and never bundles
/// anything. One rule covers both.

    //    `bundle_threshold`" (each of its four clauses puts a pair of endpoints inside the
    //    radius), so the grown satellite reaches the next member in the chain, and so
    //    on by induction.
    // 2. It is what makes the **windowed** walk correct at all. A window truncates a
    //    detection at its scanned slice's edge, and only a tract longer than
    //    `max_str_len` can be truncated — i.e. an array. A truncated member's `end`
    //    is wrong, so `is_close` cannot re-chain it, and `bundle_clusters` sees a
    //    singleton. Absorbing members first means a truncated one never reaches
    //    clustering: it is over-cap, so it lies inside its own satellite run.

///
/// Identical output to [`partition_resident`] at every `window_bp`: the window is a
/// memory knob and nothing else, which is why window-invariance is an acceptance test
/// (`windowed_matches_the_resident_oracle_*`) and not a nicety.
///
/// # How it can be windowed at all: blocks and three carries
///
/// [`resolve_features`] explains the licence — every rule the partition applies has a
/// radius, and a *block* (repeat structure bounded by more than `bundle_threshold` of
/// repeat-free sequence) is wider than all of them. So the walk holds **one open
/// block**, resolves it the moment the next feature proves it closed, and carries:
///
/// - the **open coverage run** — a satellite is longer than any window by definition,
///   so its verdict cannot be reached inside one (`CoverageRun`, extended window to
///   window);
/// - the **open bundle cluster** — its members chain across a boundary just as happily
///   as inside one; and
/// - the **open generic run** — one `u64`, [`BlockWalk::emitted_upto`]. This is what
///   makes maximality affordable: a megabase of generic sequence is not accumulated,
///   it is *not yet emitted*, and it costs one coordinate until the next feature ends
///   it.
///
/// # Where each fact comes from
///
/// - **`contig_len` comes from the reference's contig table** ([`ContigTable`]), never
///   from the window. This discharges spec §2.6's provenance obligation, outstanding
///   since A3: `classify`'s guard classifies a caller passing the *window's own end* as
///   `contig_len` — production's exact mistake, and arithmetically legal, so no
///   signature can catch it. Only a caller holding both the reference and the window
///   can, and this is that caller. Get it wrong and every locus within `bundle_threshold` of
///   every window boundary silently vanishes, a different set for each `window_bp`.
/// - **The window geometry comes from [`scan_windowed`]**, not from arithmetic here:
///   one copy of the core/margin rules, per spec §6.1.
/// - **The bases are raw** ([`RawRefSeq`]), because `SsrSegment` compares by value and
///   canonical bytes would make every IUPAC-carrying locus unequal to the catalog's
///   (spec §6).
///
/// # One fetch per window, and one margin
///
/// Admission runs over **the slice the scan already read**. It needs each tract's own
/// bases (motif, purity), which are in that slice by construction — the interval came
/// from scanning it — and it answers the flank question by arithmetic against
/// `contig_len`, which no slice could answer anyway.
///
/// So there is one margin, spec §2.6's: `max_str_len`, what makes a repeat *segment*
/// identically. Until 2026-07-17 there was a second — `bundle_threshold` on top of it — and a
/// second fetch of every window to get it, because `SsrSegment` embedded `tract ± bundle_threshold`
/// of bases and a tract at the slice's own edge could not supply them. Removing the
/// payload removed the margin, the re-fetch, and the two panics that policed it.
/// **Collected**, so it holds the contig's regions after all — this is the walk's shape
/// for a test or a small job, and [`TypedRegionIterator`] is the one that ships. It is a
/// wrapper over that iterator, not a second implementation: every window-invariance test
