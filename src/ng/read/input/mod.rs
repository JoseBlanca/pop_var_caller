//! Step 1's **input edge**: turning alignment files on disk into ordered,
//! filtered streams of reads for a region.
//!
//! Two layers, split by subject. [`open_bam`] and [`region_query`] own the
//! reader logic whose subject is **one alignment file** — the validate-on-open
//! gate, the reader pool, the BAM/CRAM region queries and the order guard
//! (`doc/devel/ng/spec/alignment_file.md`). [`merge`] and this module's
//! `SampleReads` own what is true only of **the sample** — the cross-file
//! checks and the k-way merge (`doc/devel/ng/spec/sample_reads.md`). Both
//! layers' error types live here, where the arch docs put them.
//!
//! The layering is strict: the sample layer consumes what the file layer
//! produces and contains no reader logic of its own. It is also where the
//! module's two guarantees come from — every file's `ref_id` was proved equal
//! to its `ContigId` at open, and every per-file stream was proved
//! coordinate-monotonic while streaming — which is what makes it sound for the
//! merge to compare positions *across* files without re-checking anything.
//!
//! This is step 1's input edge rather than a new step, so it lives under
//! `read/` beside `filtering.rs` and reuses that module's
//! [`RecordSource`](super::RecordSource)/[`RawRecord`](super::RawRecord) seam
//! (`doc/devel/ng/arch/module_layout.md` principle 1, note b).
