//! ng step 1 — read filtering: the whole-read keep/drop prelude. It takes the
//! reads of one sample's alignment file (BAM/CRAM) and yields the subset worth
//! carrying forward, plus a running tally of what was dropped and why. Every
//! decision is per-read, locus-independent, and content-preserving — filtering
//! *selects* reads, it never rewrites them.
//!
//! Design: `doc/devel/ng/spec/read_filtering.md` (the "why"),
//! `doc/devel/ng/arch/read_filtering.md` (types & interfaces).
//!
//! Read filtering is a **port** of the production filter stack in
//! [`crate::bam::alignment_input`]: it reuses that module's pure predicates
//! (`read_exceeds_mismatch_fraction`, `cigar_is_bad`) and its `FLAG_*` /
//! `DEFAULT_*` constants, and supplies only its own driver and config. The
//! `RecordBuf` → read decode is **no longer** production's: ng needs the read to
//! carry its read group, so it owns [`AlignedRead`] and the assembly that builds
//! it ([`crate::ng::read::aligned_read`]), while still calling production's
//! `compute_adaptor_boundary` and `cigar_to_ops` rather than reproducing them.
//!
//! The whole step is here: the step-1-local types, the two-phase `verdict_*`
//! cascade, the `RawRecord`/`RecordSource` seam with the noodles BAM/CRAM
//! adapters, and the `ReadFilter` iterator that drives them into a stream of
//! kept reads with a running drop tally.
