//! A clean-room, use-agnostic short-period **tandem-repeat scanner** — a sequence
//! primitive shared by the STR catalog and (later) the ng snp/str caller. Design:
//! spec [`doc/devel/ng/spec/ssr_repeat_scanner.md`], arch
//! [`doc/devel/ng/arch/ssr_repeat_scanner.md`].
//!
//! It exposes **three interfaces** over one detection core (a lag-`p` self-comparison
//! plus a Ruzzo–Tompa maximal-scoring-segment pass):
//!
//! - a low-level **interval finder** — `find_tandem_repeats(seq, PeriodRange,
//!   &ScanParams) -> Vec<RepeatInterval>` — raw, possibly-overlapping intervals, for
//!   consumers that resolve overlaps themselves (the STR catalog); and
//! - a mid-level **windowed scan** — [`scan_windowed`], which yields one
//!   [`ScannedWindow`] at a time (the core + margin geometry, every detection in the
//!   fetched slice, and the two window rules — coverage clipped to cores, intervals
//!   attributed by start — as methods the consumer applies to *its own* interval set)
//!   and takes **no routing decision**; for a consumer that must inject its own policy
//!   between detection and any merge — the typed-region generator, which is why this
//!   layer is public (`typed_regions.md` §6.1); and
//! - a high-level **region seam** — `RegionScanner`, a streaming iterator that yields
//!   a gap-free repeat/satellite/unique tiling of the reference, built on the above.
//!
//! The scanner holds **no consumer policy** (no purity floor, homopolymer rule, or
//! period ceiling): a consumer passes the period range it wants, and that plus the two
//! scoring weights is the whole configuration surface.
//!
//! **Clean-room note:** derived only from Benson (1999)'s published idea (compare to a
//! period-shifted copy; grow runs of matches) and our own code — **not** from the
//! AGPL-v3 `TRF-mod` source, which was not read.
//!
//! Build status (incremental, per the impl plan): **the scanner plan's Milestones A–D are
//! done** — the type vocabulary, the `find_tandem_repeats` interval finder (lag-`p`
//! scoring + a Ruzzo–Tompa maximal-scoring-segment pass), the `RegionScanner` region seam
//! (coverage-merge tiling, resident via `over_slice` and windowed-streaming via `stream`),
//! and trf-mod parity. **Plus typed-regions B1**: [`scan_windowed`] promoted from a private
//! whole-contig-eager helper to a public per-window stream (`typed_regions.md` §6.1).
//!
//! Visibility note: types are `pub` (matching the sibling ng modules, e.g. `types.rs`),
//! not the arch doc's illustrative `pub(crate)` — the ng convention exposes its module
//! vocabulary as reachable API, which also lets Milestone-A types be defined ahead of
//! their Milestone-B/C consumers without tripping `dead_code`.

/// [`ScannedWindow`] at a time** — memory-bounded (peak ≈ `window_bp +
/// 2·max_repeat_len`, not the contig length; spec §3.6).
///
/// # Why this is public, and why it streams
///
/// It is the primitive the **typed-region generator** stands on
/// (`typed_regions.md` §6.1): that walk cannot use [`RegionScanner`], because
/// `RegionScanner` merges coverage and classifies satellites **before any
/// classification policy can run**, on raw permissive intervals, with nowhere to inject
/// the pre-filter between detection and merge. The layer underneath it fits
/// exactly — this one — because it does the genuinely hard part (core + margin,
/// coverage clipped to cores, intervals attributed by start) and takes **no
/// routing decision at all**.
///
/// Streaming rather than returning two contig-wide `Vec`s is what makes it usable
/// there: the walk holds one window plus a few open coordinates, never a contig
/// (`typed_regions.md` §2.6, §7). `RegionScanner::stream` collects it right back
/// up, which is fine — it was always whole-contig-eager.
///
/// # Why the byte source is a closure and not a `ChromRefFetcher`
///
/// Because its two consumers need **different bytes**, and neither can have the
/// other's:
///
/// - `RegionScanner` reads through production's `ChromRefFetcher`, which
///   **canonicalises** (`{A,C,G,T,N}`) as it fills its buffer.
/// - The **typed-region walk** needs **raw** bytes: the STR catalog reads the FASTA
///   verbatim and `Locus` compares *by value*, so canonical bytes would make every
///   IUPAC-carrying locus compare unequal to the catalog's and silently break the
///   `.cat` oracle (`typed_regions.md` §6). That is what
///   [`crate::ng::ref_seq::WindowedRefSeq`]'s raw path exists for — and it is a
///   `RawRefSeq`, not a `ChromRefFetcher`, so it cannot be handed to a fetcher-bound
///   scan at all.
///
/// Binding this to either source would force the other to reimplement the
/// windowing — which `typed_regions.md` §6.1 names as exactly the thing not to do
/// (*"duplicates a subtle invariant that can then drift"*) — or to hold **two**
/// readers, which §6's 14.6 GB lesson forbids. A closure lets both pass their own
/// bytes through **one** copy of the window rules.
///
/// Only *classification* needs raw, incidentally: detection is case-insensitive and
/// non-ACGT never matches, so `find_tandem_repeats` gives the same answer either
/// way. That is why nothing before the walk tripped on this.
///
/// The error type is the **caller's** (`E`): this function never inspects it, only
/// propagates it, so `RegionScanner` can yield a `ScanError` and the walk a
/// `TypedRegionError` without either bending to the other. `contig_len` likewise
/// comes from the caller — the source knows its own length, and for the walk that
/// number must come from the reference's contig table (`typed_regions.md` §2.6's
/// provenance obligation), which a fetcher-derived length could not guarantee.
///
/// A fetch failure is yielded once as `Some(Err(_))`, and the iterator then stops:
/// continuing would silently scan a hole, which is the failure this module's
/// callers are least able to see. The stop is a latch ([`WindowCursor::halt`]),
/// **and the returned iterator is `FusedIterator`** — [`ScanError`]'s own doc
/// already promises this, and `std::iter::FromFn` does not provide it, so the
/// promise is declared rather than merely kept. Mirrors the ng sibling
/// `ReadFilter`, which states the same contract the same way.
///
/// This function is now a thin loop: [`WindowCursor`] holds the geometry and
/// [`scan_window`] the lift, so the walk — which cannot use this iterator at all, see
/// [`WindowCursor`] — still runs the same two rules rather than a second copy of them.
/// What it adds is the **fetch loop and the failure latch**, and that is the whole of it.
///
/// Each window fetches its core plus a `max_repeat_len` margin on **each** side and runs
/// `find_tandem_repeats` on that slice; the two derivations that make the result
/// window-invariant are [`ScannedWindow`]'s methods. The margins are load-bearing:
/// Ruzzo–Tompa segmentation is context-dependent, so a shorter margin would let a window
/// re-segment a long repeat mid-tract and emit a spurious in-core fragment.
