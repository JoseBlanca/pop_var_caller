//! Algorithm 1a — the **structured left-alignment pass**, an [`AlignmentNormalizer`].
//!
//! This is a **port, not a re-implementation**: it wraps production's
//! [`left_align_indels`](crate::pileup::walker::indel_norm) (itself a port of GATK's
//! `AlignmentUtils.leftAlignIndels`), and supplies only the trait wrapper. Nothing about
//! left-alignment is re-derived here — the plan's "reuse over rewrite" principle (arch §5, plan
//! step B1).
//!
//! # The two behaviours that make it "structured", and why they are the point
//!
//! A naive single left-to-right pass — "look at each indel, slide it one base left if the
//! neighbouring bases match" — is *assumed* to be what production does, and *assumed* to have one
//! failure: shifting one gap opens room for the next, and a single pass misses it. Production's pass
//! is not naive, and the two behaviours it has are exactly the ones that failure needs:
//!
//! - **it merges consecutive indels** — a deletion abutting an insertion (or a run of same-kind
//!   gaps) is collapsed into one canonical `D`-before-`I` event, so equal events spell the same way;
//! - **it propagates an indel across alignment blocks** rather than stopping at the first — the
//!   right-to-left walk carries a pending indel through a match block and keeps shifting into the
//!   next, so a gap slides as far left as the sequences allow, not just to the nearest boundary.
//!
//! Wrapping [`left_align_indels`] inherits both. Writing a fresh single pass here would reintroduce
//! precisely the bug those two behaviours exist to prevent, which is why this step is a wrapper and
//! its test asserts **byte-parity** against calling the production function directly.
//!
//! # It does not move `reference_offset`
//!
//! Production calls its left-aligner with end-deletion stripping **off**
//! (`remove_deletions_at_ends = false`): a deletion that rolls all the way to the read start stays a
//! first-op `Deletion`, and the alignment's start is left where it is. So this normalizer never
//! moves [`Alignment::reference_offset`]. The whole-`Alignment` signature exists because a normalizer
//! *may* need to (arch §3/§5); this one, faithfully to production, does not. A leading `Deletion` is
//! already leftmost — it has no aligned column to its left to slide across — so the property oracle
//! accepts it.
//!
//! # Isolated because its failure is silent
//!
//! A misplaced indel is a **wrong variant, not a crash**. So 1a lands as its own commit with the
//! property test green and byte-parity established, so that if indel placement ever moves, `git
//! bisect` lands here rather than in a bundle (plan step B1).
//!
//! # Algorithm 1c also lives here
//!
//! [`FixpointLeftAligner`] (1c) is a thin wrapper that applies 1a to a fixpoint, with an iteration
//! cap as a safety net that **fails loudly** (panics) rather than returning a half-normalised
//! alignment. It shares this file with 1a because it *is* 1a in a loop — no shifting of its own
//! (arch §Module home). It is the deliberate contrast with algorithm 1b, which *reports* cap
//! exhaustion instead of panicking on it.
