//! Algorithm 5 — the sequence-versus-sequence marginal.
//!
//! The probability that one sequence produced another, summed over the ways it could have,
//! with gaps allowed only near the ends (spec §5.1). It is a faithful port of production's
//! `align_subst` ([src/ssr/cohort/pair_hmm.rs](../../../ssr/cohort/pair_hmm.rs)) — **this
//! function alone**, not the `HipstrModel` that calls it: the stutter half of production's
//! read-likelihood model is the *genotyping's*, and porting it here would put a genetics
//! model inside a module that knows only about alignment (spec §5.1's boundary note).
//!
//! ## Two cases, and the common one is degenerate
//!
//! - **equal lengths** — there is exactly one way to line the two sequences up, so the sum
//!   has a single term and the result is a straight base-by-base comparison under the error
//!   rate. This is what lands here in B1.
//! - **different lengths** — the length difference is absorbed by gaps confined to a couple
//!   of bases of either end; the sum then runs over the few ways that can happen, a genuine
//!   banded forward pass. That lands in B2, and **interior gaps are forbidden** — an indel
//!   in the middle of the repeat is what the *stutter* model explains, so letting this
//!   algorithm explain it too would make base error and slippage indistinguishable.
//!
//! ## Why this works in linear space, and holds a flat rate rather than the `Emission` component
//!
//! It runs in **ordinary probabilities**, exactly as `align_subst` does, and converts to a
//! logarithm once at the trait boundary (B3) — which spec §7 explicitly permits ("run its
//! matrix in ordinary probabilities and take a single logarithm at the end, safe at repeat
//! sizes"). Two reasons make linear the right space here rather than the module's log-space
//! [`Emission`](super::Emission) component:
//!
//! - The B2 forward **sums** probabilities across paths. In linear space that is a
//!   multiply-and-add, as in the source; in log space each add is a `logsumexp`, dearer and
//!   a different rounding — which would break parity against the very function being ported.
//! - The oracle for this port is production's linear `align_subst` (B3 checks parity against
//!   it). Matching its arithmetic means matching its representation.
//!
//! So the flat per-base error rate ε is held **directly**, not as a
//! [`FlatEmission`](super::FlatEmission) (whose scores are logarithms). The tie to the
//! emission component is the shared *validation* — the checked constructor rejects the same
//! out-of-range rates [`FlatEmission::try_new`](super::FlatEmission::try_new) does, via the
//! same [`DomainError::ErrorRate`] — and the shared flat-rate *concept*, not the
//! representation. (Recorded reconciliation: the plan's preconditions note said algorithm 5
//! "reuses the Emission component"; the design authority it cites — spec §5.1, §7, and the
//! arch's "port this function … returns a linear probability, convert at the boundary" —
//! requires the linear form, which the log-space component cannot provide without `exp()`
//! round-trips that defeat parity.)
