//! **Byte-parity of ng's tract delimiter against production's — the port anchor.**
//!
//! Algorithm 3 ([`SsrFlatGapAligner`](super::ssr_best_path_flat_gap::SsrFlatGapAligner)) is
//! a port of production's `delimit_read`, and it is the **only aligner in this module with a
//! parity oracle**: algorithms 2, 4, 5 and 6 are *measured*, not verified (spec §10.3, arch
//! §Test & bench shape). So this test is what the whole port rests on, and it is what makes
//! Milestone C's banding a *performance* change rather than a behaviour change — banding
//! must leave every assertion here untouched.
//!
//! # What parity means here, exactly
//!
//! Production answers with a two-case `Delimited`: a `Region(range)` or a side-blind
//! `BorderOffEnd`. ng answers with the four-case [`RepeatSpan`]. The two are **not** the same
//! shape, because the widening is the point of step B2 — so parity is asserted where the two
//! are comparable and *counted* where they are not:
//!
//! - **Every read production calls `Region` must measure the same bytes here.** Not the same
//!   *classification* — the same **offsets**, which is the measurement itself. This is the
//!   hard assertion.
//! - **Every read production calls `BorderOffEnd` must land in a one-flank or no-flank
//!   case.** It cannot be checked against production more finely than that, because
//!   production discarded the information: `BorderOffEnd` does not say which flank was
//!   missing. So the reclassification is checked **by count and by shape**, which is all the
//!   oracle can support (plan step B3).
//!
//! # Why this lives in `src/ng/` and reads `src/ssr/`
//!
//! It is **ng's test**: its subject is ng's aligner, and production is only the yardstick.
//! `src/ssr/` is frozen (owner, 2026-07-16) and is read here, never written — the same shape
//! as [`scanner_parity`](crate::ng::scanner_parity), and the same shape as the slip-cutoff
//! cross-check in [`stutter`](super::stutter). It is `#[cfg(test)]`, so **shipping ng code
//! still depends on nothing in production**.
