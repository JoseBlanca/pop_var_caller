//! **The leftmost property checker — the normalizers' oracle.**
//!
//! This module's normalizers (algorithms 1a/1b/1c, Milestones B–C) are graded against a
//! *definition*, not against each other. "Leftmost" is one: for any output, take each indel,
//! shift it one base to the left, and ask whether the result still represents the same read
//! against the same reference without introducing a mismatch. If it does, the output was **not**
//! leftmost. This is the only comparison in the whole alignment module that has ground truth
//! without a rival implementation, which is why the plan builds it **first**, before any
//! normalizer exists, and lets it **outrank agreement** between the three (spec §6, arch §Test &
//! bench shape; plan step A2).
//!
//! # Why this is not a call into `normalize_alleles`
//!
//! Production's [`normalize_alleles`](crate::ng::alignment::norm_seqs::normalize_alleles) *is* a left-aligner,
//! and algorithm 1a will port it. If this checker were built on it, it would grade 1a against
//! itself — an oracle has to be independent of the thing it grades. So the shift test here is
//! written straight from the definition: it looks at each indel and the aligned column
//! immediately to its left, and applies the one-base-left shift condition directly.
//!
//! # The shift condition, exactly
//!
//! An indel can slide one base left only by **crossing an aligned column that is a real match**
//! — left-alignment is a *lossless* re-placement that never moves a mismatch (production's port
//! asserts the read's mismatch count is unchanged, [`indel_norm`](crate::ng::alignment::indel_norm)). So an
//! indel with the aligned column `(read[q-1] ↔ reference[r-1])` immediately to its left can shift
//! one base left iff that column matches **and** the base leaving the indel on the left equals the
//! base entering it from the right:
//!
//! - **deletion** of `reference[s..e)`: `reference[s-1] == read[q-1]` (crossed column matches) and
//!   `read[q-1] == reference[e-1]` (far edge preserved) — together, `reference[s-1] ==
//!   reference[e-1]`, crossed through a matching read base;
//! - **insertion** of `read[a..b)`: `reference[r-1] == read[a-1]` and `read[a-1] == read[b-1]`.
//!
//! This is exactly the pair of predicates production's `normalize_alleles` tests at each step —
//! `next_base_on_left_is_same` and `last_base_on_right_is_same` — arrived at from the definition
//! rather than borrowed from the code, so the two agreeing is a *result*, not an assumption.
//!
//! A subtle consequence worth stating: an indel sitting in a homopolymer whose left neighbour is
//! a **mismatch** is already leftmost, because the mismatch cannot be crossed — normalization is
//! placement within a fixed match/mismatch structure, not re-alignment. The tests pin that case.
//!
//! `#[cfg(test)]`: this is test support for the normalizers. It ships no production code.
