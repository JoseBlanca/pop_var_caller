//! Algorithm 4 — the repeat-aware best-path aligner with **two penalties**: a whole-unit
//! slip priced from the [`StutterModel`], everything else priced as an ordinary gap.
//!
//! Algorithm 3 ([`super::ssr_best_path_flat_gap`]) charges one flat per-base gap anywhere
//! inside the tract, so a three-unit expansion costs three units' worth of per-base gaps.
//! This aligner instead prices a **whole-unit** slip by the stutter model — direction-
//! asymmetric, geometric in the number of units — and keeps the flat gap only for the
//! *out-of-frame* changes that are not a whole number of units (spec §4.2). It is the
//! HipSTR-shaped model, and it is the more faithful of the two; which one measures better is
//! the Milestone-D comparison, and **neither is settled** (spec §10.3).
//!
//! **This algorithm has no parity oracle.** Algorithm 3 is a port of production's delimiter
//! and can be shown byte-identical to it; algorithm 4 is new (arch §5: "no production
//! counterpart"), so it is *measured*, not verified. Its tests establish that it computes
//! what it claims — the three properties the spec makes mandatory, plus the degenerate cases
//! — not that it matches an external truth. What confidence it has comes from the differential
//! against algorithm 3 (the byte-parity-validated sibling), which is exactly why algorithm 3
//! is kept rather than deleted (see [`super::ssr_best_path_flat_gap`]).
//!
//! **This is the recommended STR delimiter.** It measured better than algorithm 3 in the D2
//! comparison (`doc/devel/reports/research/ssr_delimiter_3v4_comparison_2026-07-23.md`) — more
//! accurate, and without the small reference-pull bias the flat-gap model carries. Whether to
//! formally *adopt* it turns on the genotype comparison, which lives with the genotyping
//! (spec §10.3) and has not run; the measurement evidence points here.
//!
//! # The recurrence, and the three decisions behind it
//!
//! Algorithm 3's M / I / D matrix, unchanged, **plus two whole-unit slip states** inside the
//! tract: `SlipIns` (the read carries an extra unit the reference does not) and `SlipDel`
//! (the reference carries a unit the read does not). A slip transition jumps `period` cells
//! at once, which is why the score scratch keeps a small ring of the last `period + 1` rows
//! rather than the two rolling rows algorithm 3 needs.
//!
//! 1. **The geometric decomposes onto affine slip transitions.** Writing `longer` for
//!    `whole_repeat_longer_share`, `shorter` for `whole_repeat_shorter_share` and `one_step`
//!    for `whole_repeat_one_step_share`, the stutter probability of an `n`-unit expansion is
//!    `longer · one_step · (1 − one_step)^(n − 1)`
//!    (`doc/devel/ng/spec/read_likelihoods.md` §4.2), which in log space is
//!    `[ln(longer · one_step)] + (n − 1)·[ln(1 − one_step)]` — an affine *open* plus
//!    `n − 1` *extends*. So a run of unit slips is priced exactly like an affine gap, one
//!    open and then extends, and the direction split (`longer` vs `shorter`) is the asymmetry
//!    the spec demands.
//!
//! 2. **The slip cost is relative to no-slip.** A best-path aligner *maximises*, and only
//!    relative scores matter in an argmax — so the same-length share (the stutter probability
//!    of Δ = 0) is folded into the baseline: no slip scores `0`, and an `n`-unit slip scores
//!    `ln(P(n)) − ln(same_length_share)`. This is the only place that share can live in a
//!    Viterbi, since Δ = 0 corresponds to *not taking* a slip transition and so has nothing to
//!    attach a cost to. The open cost therefore carries the `− ln(same_length_share)` term;
//!    the extend does not.
//!
//! 3. **A slipped unit's bases are scored against the motif** (decided with the owner,
//!    2026-07-23): an inserted unit that really is a copy of the repeat is rewarded, and one
//!    whose bases are wrong pays a mismatch — which is production's behaviour (its `q_r`
//!    resizes the candidate by tiling the motif and scores composition, `hipstr.rs`), and it
//!    is what makes the arithmetic in-frame test catch a wrong-base insertion downstream as a
//!    base error rather than as stutter (spec §4.2). A deletion consumes reference bases and
//!    so scores nothing.
//!
//! **Placement multiplicity: best placement, no divide** (decided with the owner). Production
//! *sums* over the reachable placements of a slip and divides by their count (`reach_variants`,
//! `1/|placements|`) — a marginal operation. A best-path aligner cannot: it maximises, so it
//! picks the single best-scoring placement. Here that falls out for free — the Viterbi may
//! start a slip at *any* tract column, and its max over those columns is the best placement.
//! The gap between this max and production's sum is a real difference between a ruler and a
//! score, and it is one of the things the Milestone-D comparison exists to measure.
//!
//! **This aligner is, by design, a ruler that prices toward tidy in-frame lengths.** Making a
//! whole-unit slip cheap pulls the measurement toward a whole number of units — which is the
//! §4.2 risk (does it round an interruption away?), and precisely the hypothesis the
//! comparison tests. It is intended, not a defect.
