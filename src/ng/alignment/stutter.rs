//! The stutter model — how likely each length change is, for one repeat.
//!
//! **Not an alignment algorithm**, and it lives here anyway because *two* consumers share
//! it: the two-penalty best-path aligner in this module (spec §4.2), and the genotyping
//! likelihood outside it. One description, so the two cannot drift apart (spec §5.2). It
//! is HipSTR's model.
//!
//! Everything here is a **linear probability**, not a logarithm — unlike HipSTR's own
//! fields, which are logs (`log_equal_`), and matching production's `stutter_pmf`, which
//! also returns a linear value. The module carries no `_ln` names for that reason; a value
//! that ever does become a logarithm must say so in its name (the crate-wide convention).
//!
//! ## The two regimes are the model's defining structure
//!
//! A read's length change is either a whole number of repeat units or it is not, and the
//! two mean different things:
//!
//! - **in frame** — a whole number of units. This is slippage, the common event, and its
//!   size is measured in **units**.
//! - **out of frame** — not a whole number of units. This is a sequencing indel or an
//!   interruption, not slippage; it is rarer, it gets its **own** parameters, and its size
//!   is measured in **base pairs**.
//!
//! Each regime splits again by direction, because stutter is asymmetric: **losing units is
//! more common than gaining them**.
//!
//! **Which regime applies is decided by arithmetic alone** — is the change a multiple of
//! the period? — and **never by what was actually inserted**. So an insertion that happens
//! to be period-sized is treated as slippage whether or not its bases are the repeat unit.
//! The composition is caught downstream instead, as a base-error mismatch against the
//! re-tiled candidate. The mis-routing is worst at period 1, where it catches roughly three
//! of every four single-base insertions — which is why the algorithm-3-versus-4 comparison
//! (Milestone D) must score an indel *of the repeat's own base* separately from an indel of
//! a different base, or the two effects cancel in the average (spec §4.2).
