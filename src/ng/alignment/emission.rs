//! Emission — scoring one read base against one reference base.
//!
//! This is a **component, not a variant**: per-base quality and a flat error rate are two
//! configurations of the same algorithm, which is what makes comparing them a swap rather
//! than a fork (spec §3). Every aligner in this module takes its emission model as a type
//! parameter, never behind `dyn` — this is called once per matrix cell, so a virtual call
//! per cell is not affordable (arch §4). The `Sized` supertrait on [`Emission`] makes that
//! decision a compile error rather than a convention.
//!
//! Two implementations land here: [`PerQualityEmission`], which reads the read's own
//! quality score, and [`FlatEmission`], which ignores it in favour of one rate. The first
//! is the default, on the reasoning that the read already carries a confidence for every
//! base and throwing it away to align the read would discard information we paid for
//! (spec §4.1); the second is the quality-blind end of the comparison.
//!
//! ## The scores must stay bit-equal to production
//!
//! [`PerQualityEmission`]'s table is ported from `EMISSION_LN`
//! ([src/ssr/pileup/alignment.rs](../../../ssr/pileup/alignment.rs)), and the repeat-aware
//! aligner built on it has to reproduce production's measured repeats **byte for byte** —
//! that parity is this module's only hard oracle (spec §10.3). So these are not merely
//! "close enough" numbers: reformulating the arithmetic in a way that moves the last bit
//! moves every downstream score. `per_quality_table_is_bit_exact` exists to make such a
//! change fail loudly instead of silently.

/// **Total** is the sharp end: *no* argument may produce a non-finite score. In

/// worthless base. Production floors it precisely to stop that (spec §4.2), and both
/// implementations here inherit the floor. `emission_is_finite_at_every_quality` pins it.

///
/// Bases are compared by **raw byte equality**, exactly as production does. Two
/// consequences the caller owns, because nothing here can check them without paying for
/// it on every cell:
///
/// - **Case matters.** A soft-masked reference spells its bases in lower case, and `b'a'`
///   is not `b'A'` — a soft-masked stretch would score as a mismatch at every base.
///   Soft-masking marks repeats, which is precisely where the repeat-aware aligner works,
///   so this is not a remote hazard. ng offers both shapes deliberately:
///   [`RefSeq::fetch`] canonicalizes (upper-cases ACGT, folds everything else to `N`)
///   while [`RawRefSeq`] returns bases verbatim, soft-mask intact. **Feed this the
///   canonical form.**
/// - **`N` is a base like any other here.** An `N` read base against an `N` reference
///   base scores a full-confidence *match*. Neither this component nor production's
///   treats ambiguity specially; if that should change it is a scoring-model decision for
///   the aligner steps, not a silent fix here.
