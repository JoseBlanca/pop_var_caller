//! Algorithm 3 — the repeat-aware best-path aligner with **two gap regimes and one flat
//! gap inside the repeat**. This is ng's tract delimiter, and the module's **only
//! byte-parity oracle**.
//!
//! # Not the recommended delimiter — kept as the oracle and the baseline
//!
//! **[`super::ssr_best_path_unit_slip`] (algorithm 4) measured better and is the recommended
//! STR delimiter.** On synthetic reads with known truth it was uniformly more accurate and
//! free of the small reference-pull bias this flat-gap model carries (the D2 comparison,
//! `doc/devel/reports/research/ssr_delimiter_3v4_comparison_2026-07-23.md`). So a new caller
//! that just wants to measure a repeat should reach for algorithm 4, not this.
//!
//! Algorithm 3 is **retained deliberately, not deprecated**, for two reasons that outrank the
//! measurement result:
//!
//! - **It is the module's only byte-parity oracle.** This is a port of production's
//!   `delimit_read`, held byte-identical to it over a 200,000-case soak (`delimit_parity`).
//!   Algorithm 4 has **no oracle of its own** — its correctness rests on the differential
//!   cross-check *against this aligner* (`algorithm_4_agrees_with_algorithm_3_on_clean_reads`).
//!   Removing or disabling algorithm 3 would delete the only thing that validates algorithm 4.
//! - **Adoption is not settled here.** D2 measured which ruler is more accurate; whether to
//!   *adopt* algorithm 4 turns on the genotype comparison, which spans this module and the
//!   genotyping that composes it (spec §10.3) and has not run. The measurement points to 4;
//!   the decision is downstream.
//!
//! So this is not disabled by a panic or removed: doing either would break the oracle and the
//! validation of the algorithm it would be promoting. The steering belongs at the **selection
//! site** — when the STR read preparer is wired up it should instantiate algorithm 4, and any
//! future user-facing choice should omit algorithm 3 from its menu while keeping the type
//! compilable for these tests.
//!
//! It is the same alignment as the affine aligner, but with two gap regimes along the
//! reference: a **stiff** gap in the flanks and a **soft** one inside the tract. The
//! reasoning is that flanks are clean unique sequence and should hold the tract's edges in
//! place, while length variation inside the tract is expected — it is the repeat changing
//! size, not an error. With a single stiff gap everywhere, any allele more than about one
//! unit from the reference collapses back onto the reference; production hit exactly that
//! failure before splitting the regimes (spec §4.2).
//!
//! Because the flanks stay anchored, the two flank-to-tract boundary columns of the
//! resulting line-up say where the read's repeat starts and ends — which is how this
//! aligner *measures* a read's repeat.
//!
//! # Unbanded, deliberately
//!
//! Production fills its whole matrix. This port does too, because **only an unbanded port
//! can be shown byte-identical to it**, and that parity is this module's one hard oracle
//! (spec §3, §10.3). Banding lands as its own separately-proved change in Milestone C, at
//! which point the same fixture must produce the same output — which is what makes banding
//! a performance change rather than a behaviour change.
//!
//! # A known inconsistency, reproduced on purpose
//!
//! Production computes the match→match probability **once**, from the *flank* gap-open
//! (`1 − 2 × 2.9e-5`), and never recomputes it under the tract regime. So inside the tract
//! the three transitions leaving a match sum to about **1.02** rather than 1, while in the
//! flanks they sum to exactly 1.
//!
//! Be precise about what that skews. It is *direction*-symmetric — insertion and deletion
//! get the same tract open — so it does not favour longer over shorter. But normalising
//! would divide all three by 1.02 **at every departure from a match**, and a path carrying
//! an *L*-base gap passes through about *L* fewer matches than the diagonal does. So the
//! un-normalised model quietly penalises the length-changing path by roughly 1.02 per
//! gapped base — about 1.2× at a 10 bp change, 1.8× at 30 bp. **The bias is toward the
//! reference length, and it grows with the size of the change.** That is the same class of
//! bias the tract regime exists to remove; it is dominated today by the 350× open ratio,
//! which is why it has never shown up in results, but anyone who narrows that ratio or
//! lengthens the tract inherits an unstated pull toward reference.
//!
//! It is reproduced here rather than fixed because **reproducing it silently and fixing it
//! silently both end with a parity test failing for a reason nobody can find** (spec §4.2).

///    long-allele test aligns 52 bases against 28 and needs 24 cells of deviation, which no
///    fixed width covers).
///
/// 2. **`left_flank + right_flank` — the run-off correction, and a departure from the spec.**
///    Spec §3 modelled the band as the floor plus a *small constant* headroom, and §9 left
///    the amount open. That model is **insufficient for this aligner, and it fails silently**:
///    a read that expands the tract *and* runs off a flank has an optimal path whose peak
///    deviation is the tract expansion, while its *net* length difference is smaller by the
///    run-off flank's length. So the path strays past the `|read − reference|` corridor by up
///    to the flank length — far more than a constant. The parity oracle caught this at a
///    left-flankless locus (a 43-base read of a 7-unit tract against a 4-unit, 34-base frame:
///    peak deviation 18, floor 9). Bounding the stray by the two flank lengths is derived from
///    the alignment *geometry*, not the scoring model, so it keeps the spec's separation of
///    the ruler from the slip cutoff.
///
///    `SPEC-FOLLOWUP(alignment §3/§9)`: the spec models the band as floor + a constant

///    band above. Owner to fold in (delegated 2026-07-23); recorded in the C1 impl report and
///    `PROJECT_STATUS.md` so the deferral is tracked, not only in this comment.
///
/// 3. **`BAND_HEADROOM` — this constant.** With the floor and the run-off covered, what is
///    left is a genuine score-neutral bow: an insertion balanced by a later deletion, net
///    zero. Every such bow pays two gap events whose transition cost is strictly negative in
