//! ng alignment — lining a read up against a reference stretch.
//!
//! This is a **folder, not a file**, because it holds competing implementations that get
//! compared: the three aligner and normalizer traits will live here in `mod.rs` and each
//! algorithm sits in its own file beside its siblings — as does the shared [`emission`]
//! component (`doc/devel/ng/arch/alignment.md` §Module home). File names say
//! which trait an algorithm implements and whether it is repeat-aware, because both are
//! load-bearing — the best-path and marginal families implement *different* traits, and
//! every repeat-aware algorithm has an affine counterpart it must not be confused with.
//!
//! **It is not a pipeline step, and it knows none.** Step 2 (read preparation) and step 7
//! (read likelihood) both call it; it knows about neither. It takes sequences and returns
//! alignments or probabilities, which is why it sits outside the step-per-module rule
//! rather than breaking it (`doc/devel/ng/spec/alignment.md` §1).
//!
//! Landed so far: [`Alignment`] and [`RepeatSpan`], the two output shapes; [`RepeatGeometry`]
//! and [`RepeatContext`], which tell a repeat-aware algorithm where the repeat sits and how it
//! slips; the [`BestPathAligner`] and [`MarginalAligner`] traits they meet at; and the two
//! shared components, the [`emission`] scoring every aligner uses and the [`stutter`] model;
//! and the first algorithm, [`ssr_best_path_flat_gap`] — the repeat-aware delimiter, which is
//! this module's **only byte-parity oracle** against production (`delimit_parity`, test-only).
//! The [`MarginalAligner`] trait has two implementations: algorithm 5
//! ([`ssr_marginal_sequence`] — the sequence-versus-sequence marginal, a linear-space port of
//! production's `align_subst`, byte-parity-checked against it) and algorithm 6
//! ([`ssr_marginal_whole_read`] — the whole-read two-regime forward, new code with no port
//! oracle, run with fixed synthetic qualities). Still to come in
//! `doc/devel/ng/impl_plan/alignment_best_path.md`: the affine aligner (E, gated).

/// lie. `Context` is `()` for the affine aligner, which needs nothing locus-specific, and
/// [`RepeatContext`] for the others. `Scratch` is per-algorithm, never one shared buffer.
///
/// **`Context` carries a lifetime, and is passed by value.** The architecture sketch has a
/// plain `type Context` taken by reference, but the repeat context *is* two references —
/// the geometry and the stutter model both travel per call and are borrowed, so that they
/// need not be rebuilt per locus across millions of loci. A plain associated type could
/// only name that as `RepeatContext<'static>`, which would force every caller to own its
/// locus data forever. So `Context<'a>` is generic over the lifetime, and since the value
/// is two pointers and `Copy`, taking a reference *to* it would only add indirection.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// **Pure per call.** The output is a function of the arguments and the implementation's
/// own constructor state, with no hidden mutation beyond `Scratch` — so results never
/// depend on call order or thread count, which the cohort's byte-identity guarantee rests
/// on. `Scratch` is caller-owned and reused; an implementation that allocates per call is a
/// defect, not a slow path.
///
/// **Determinism, and why it is a correctness rule rather than a nicety.** Two reads of the
/// same molecule must measure the same repeat. Where several line-ups score equally, an
/// arbitrary choice between them lets identical input produce different repeat lengths, so
/// two rules settle every tie (spec §4.2):
///
/// - prefer **match, then deletion, then insertion**, both within the alignment and when
///   choosing which state the alignment ends in;
/// - a gap landing exactly on a flank/repeat junction belongs to the block on its **5′
///   side** — an insertion at the left junction joins the flank, one at the right junction
///   joins the repeat.
///
/// **No `Result`, deliberately.** A fallible alignment would push error handling onto the
/// caller's hottest path for cases that are answers, not failures: an empty reference gives
/// [`RepeatSpan::Unanchored`], not an error. Two conditions are instead the **caller's** to
/// uphold, because nothing here can check them cheaply:

/// - the geometry must fit the reference it is used with — [`RepeatGeometry::fits_reference`].

/// to be reachable from untrusted input, it becomes a checked constructor on the context
/// type — not a `Result` on this call (arch §3).

/// - `Output` is not an associated type here, unlike [`BestPathAligner`]: a marginal is
///   *always* one [`LogProb`], so there is nothing to vary.
/// - `Context` is `()` for the sequence-versus-sequence marginal (algorithm 5), which needs
///   nothing locus-specific — it compares two bare sequences under a fixed error rate — and
///   [`RepeatContext`] for the whole-read forward (algorithm 6), which needs the repeat's
///   geometry to know where its flanks end. As on [`BestPathAligner`], `Context` carries a
///   lifetime and is passed by value: the repeat context *is* two borrowed references, so a
///   plain associated type could only name it as `RepeatContext<'static>` and force every
///   caller to own its locus data forever. `Copy` because it is two pointers or nothing at
///   all; taking a reference to it would only add indirection.
/// - `Scratch` is the reused forward-matrix buffer, per-algorithm, never one shared type.
///
/// # The read carries no qualities, deliberately
///
/// `read` is a bare `&[u8]`, not a [`ReadBases`]: production's marginal scores with a
/// **single flat error rate**, not per-base qualities (spec §5.1, §7). That choice is
/// load-bearing beyond this trait — per-base qualities are per *read*, so keeping them would
/// stop identical-sequence reads collapsing into one tallied row (spec §9) — so it is fixed
/// in the signature rather than left to each implementation. An implementation that wanted
/// per-base qualities would take them the same way [`BestPathAligner`] does.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// **Pure per call**, exactly as [`BestPathAligner`]: the output is a function of the
/// arguments and the implementation's own constructor state (its emission model), with no
/// hidden mutation beyond `Scratch` — so the result never depends on call order or thread
/// count, which the cohort's byte-identity guarantee rests on. `Scratch` is caller-owned and
/// reused; an implementation that allocates per call is a defect, not a slow path. There is
/// **no tie-break rule** to state — a sum has no ties to break, which is one of the things
/// that makes the marginal simpler than the best path.
///
/// **No `Result`, deliberately** (arch §3). A line-up that cannot happen is an *answer*, not
/// a failure: it returns `LogProb(f64::NEG_INFINITY)`, the value the logarithm contract
/// exists to make visible. As with [`BestPathAligner`], the one condition a repeat-aware
/// implementation cannot check cheaply — that the geometry fits the reference
/// ([`RepeatGeometry::fits_reference`]) — is the caller's to uphold, a documented
/// precondition plus a debug assertion, not an error variant.
///
/// The `Sized` supertrait is deliberate and matches [`BestPathAligner`]: implementations are

/// result — and equivalent alignments spelled differently look like different variants, so
/// their supporting reads scatter instead of pooling. Left-alignment shifts every gap as far
/// left as it can go without introducing a mismatch, and merges adjacent gaps of the same
/// kind. Nothing about the alignment's quality changes; only its spelling (spec §6).
///
/// It shares **no machinery** with [`BestPathAligner`] and [`MarginalAligner`]: no dynamic
/// programming, no matrix, no scratch. It is in this module only because it operates on
/// alignments, and it is a separate trait because it is a separate task (spec §1, §6).
///
/// # Why it takes the whole [`Alignment`], not just its operations
///
/// Left-alignment can shift a **leading deletion off the front** of the alignment, which drops
/// the deletion and moves where the placement starts — its [`Alignment::reference_offset`].
/// Production's structured pass does exactly that (`left_align_cigar` with end-deletion
/// stripping; [indel_norm.rs](../../../pileup/walker/indel_norm.rs)). A signature over the
/// operations alone (`&mut Vec<CigarOp>`) could not express that move, so it would silently
/// foreclose a normalizer that needs it (arch §3, §5).
///
/// # Why the read is required, and why it carries no qualities
///
/// How far a gap may shift is bounded by matching on **both** sequences — a base can only move
/// left across a reference base it equals *and* a read base it equals. So the read is not
/// optional context; it is half of what defines "leftmost". But it arrives as a bare `&[u8]`,
/// not a [`ReadBases`]: normalization shifts gaps by comparing **bases**, never quality
/// scores, so it is quality-blind by construction and there are no qualities to pass (spec §6).
///

///
/// **Pure per call**, like the two aligner traits: the output is a function of the arguments
/// and the implementation's own constructor state, with no hidden state — so the result never
/// depends on call order or thread count. There is no `Scratch` associated type, because these
/// algorithms fill no matrix; a normalizer that wants a reusable buffer owns it as its own
/// field. **No `Result`:** an alignment that is already leftmost is normalized to itself, an
/// answer rather than a failure, so `normalize` returns nothing and mutates in place.
///

/// - **1b** [`RepeatedLeftAligner`](left_align_repeated::RepeatedLeftAligner) — freebayes' repeated
///   capped passes. It can ship a *non-leftmost* result (its 20-pass cap), so it is the comparator
///   that shows freebayes' shape is worse here, not a production candidate.
/// - **1c** [`FixpointLeftAligner`](left_align_structured::FixpointLeftAligner) — 1a to a fixpoint; built only to *test* whether 1a is a true
///   fixpoint. It is, empirically (the differ-at-all screen saw 0 panics and 0 disagreements with 1a
///   across 63,821 real and adversarial reads), so 1c is retained as a regression guard, not a
