//! Mapped-read file input — BAM and CRAM.
//!
//! Named `bam/` (not `cram/`) because BAM is the more common name for
//! mapped-read files. The module hosts the format-agnostic header-
//! validation + per-read filter surface (in [`alignment_input`]) plus
//! two per-format open helpers ([`cram_input`] and [`bam_input`]); the
//! actual per-segment read fetch lives in [`segment_reader`] /
//! [`segment_merge`].
//!
//! - [`alignment_input`] — validates a list of coordinate-sorted
//!   alignment files for one sample (their `@SQ` headers against each
//!   other, a single sample name, coordinate sort order) via
//!   [`alignment_input::load_pileup_inputs`], and owns the
//!   format-agnostic per-read filter cascade
//!   ([`alignment_input::AlignmentMergedReaderConfig`]) plus the shared
//!   `RecordBuf` → [`alignment_input::MappedRead`] conversion the
//!   segment readers feed through.
//! - [`errors`] — typed I/O errors raised by the alignment-file
//!   readers. Reused downstream by the BAQ stream and the cohort
//!   CLI's error bridge, which is why they live here at the
//!   module root rather than inside `alignment_input`.
//! - [`index_preflight`] — `.crai` / `.bai` / `.csi` detection +
//!   opt-in auto-build for callers that need per-contig random
//!   access (e.g. the per-chromosome parallel `var-calling-from-bam`
//!   driver).
//!
//! The walker-side input types ([`MappedRead`](alignment_input::MappedRead)
//! → [`crate::pileup::walker::PreparedRead`]) are produced here and
//! consumed by the BAQ glue ([`crate::pileup::per_sample::baq_engine`])
//! and then by the walker. CIGAR ops use [`crate::pileup::walker::CigarOp`].

// `bam_input` and `cram_input` are the per-format record-stream
