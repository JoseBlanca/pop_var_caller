//! A shared, thread-safe indexed-segment read source.
//!
//! Given a coordinate-sorted + indexed BAM/CRAM and a genomic segment
//! `[start, end]` (1-based inclusive) on a contig, [`AlignmentFile`]
//! returns the reads whose reference footprint overlaps that segment.
//! It exploits the coordinate-sort: index-seek to the segment, then
//! linear-scan in coordinate order until past the segment end.
//!
//! The primitive is built for the SSR Stage-1 fetcher, which queries
//! ~10⁶ tiny loci. The cost it removes versus re-running the existing
//! per-`query` scanners is the per-call file re-open + header re-parse
//! (and, for CRAM, container re-decode of the file header): each
//! [`AlignmentFile`] holds a **pool of idle open readers**, so the
//! Nth segment call on a thread reuses the reader the (N-1)th left
//! behind rather than opening the file again. The file is opened
//! roughly once per concurrent caller (≈ once per thread at the SSR
//! driver's "one segment per thread" rate), then reused.
//!
//! # Thread-safety
//!
//! [`AlignmentFile`] is `Sync`: the index and header map are shared
//! `Arc`s, the filter config is immutable `Copy`, and the reader pool
//! is a `Mutex<Vec<_>>` locked only for the pop/push at the iterator's
//! creation and drop — never during iteration. Many threads call
//! [`AlignmentFile::get_reads_from_segment`] concurrently for
//! different segments through a shared `&AlignmentFile`; each call
//! borrows its own reader, so there is no shared cursor and no lock
//! held across work.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! - **Not a multi-file merge.** One file → its reads for a segment.
//!   A sample spread across several files is each queried separately
//!   and combined by the driver (SSR's reservoir is order-independent,
//!   so it just concatenates).
//! - **Not a clipper.** A read overlapping two queried segments is
//!   yielded *whole* by both calls; the consumer decides what to do
//!   with the part outside its segment.
//!
//! The per-record decode reuses the existing per-format helpers
//! ([`crate::bam::alignment_input`]'s `classify_pre_decode` /
//! `record_buf_to_mapped_read`, [`crate::bam::bam_input`]'s
//! `query_interval`, and `ContigInterval::overlaps_record`); only the
//! reader ownership + pooling is new here. The existing
//! `OwnedIndexed{Bam,Cram}Records` scanners are left in place — they
//! still back `AlignmentMergedReader::query` until the SNP `--regions`
//! path is retrofitted onto this primitive (a separate, measured
//! change).

// The primitive's only live consumers are its own tests until the SSR
// Stage-1 fetcher (increment #4) and the SNP `--regions` retrofit
// (increment #5) are wired onto it — both deferred to their own
// measured changes per the implementation plan. Without that wiring the
// public surface (`get_reads_from_segment`, the CRAM path, the dispatch
// enum) is reachable only from `#[cfg(test)]`, which reads as dead code
// to the non-test lib build. Suppress that — but only in the non-test
// build, so the test build still flags any genuinely-dead helper added
// later. Remove the attribute entirely when the consumer lands.
