//! Stage 1's sequential pileup walker — turns a coordinate-sorted
//! stream of prepared (filtered + BAQ-adjusted) reads into the
//! per-position records that Stage 2 encodes to the `.psp` file.
//!
//! See `doc/devel/specs/pileup_walker.md` for the implementation-ready
//! specification. This module ships the walker (`PreparedRead`,
//! `WalkerError`, `WalkerConfig`, and the public entry point `run`).
//! The per-position record types it emits (`PileupRecord`,
//! `AlleleObservation`, `AlleleSupportStats`, `ChainId`) live in
//! [`crate::pileup_record`]; the reference-FASTA fetcher trait
//! (`MultiChromRefFetcher`) and its implementations live in
//! [`crate::fasta`] — both are pipeline-wide concerns, not walker
//! internals. Internal building blocks live in private submodules.
