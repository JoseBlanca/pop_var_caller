//! Driver / wiring — section orchestration (appendix §G).
//!
//! Wires the staged pipeline read → fold → compact → caller → writer and
//! exposes the cohort `.psp` → VCF entry point ([`run_var_calling`]) the CLI
//! invokes.
//!
//! **Parallel topology.** A bounded-`crossbeam-channel` pipeline inside a
//! [`std::thread::scope`], all hand-offs count-bounded for back-pressure (peak
//! tracks the queue capacities, not scheduling):
//!
//! 1. **read stage** ([`drive_read_stage`]) — owns the per-sample readers,
//!    decodes each sample's light-column segments ahead on the producer pool
//!    into per-sample bounded queues (depth [`READ_QUEUE_DEPTH`]);
//! 2. **fold/plan stage** (main thread, the [`CohortChunkIntegrator`]) — pulls
//!    decoded segments, folds the light columns to find the chunk's variable
//!    positions + safe-gap cut, fetches its REF span, and ships a `ChunkPlan`
//!    (still-compressed per-sample segments, shared by `Arc`) over a depth-2
//!    queue;
//! 3. **compact stage** ([`compact_plan`]) — inflates only those segments' heavy
//!    columns for the variable rows and ships a [`RawCohortChunk`];
//! 4. `W` **caller threads** ([`VariantCaller`]) pop chunks, call them, push
//!    [`CalledChunk`]s;
//! 5. one **writer thread** ([`VcfWriter`]) drains them, reordering by
//!    `chunk_order` via a `BTreeMap` so the emitted VCF is in genomic order
//!    regardless of how the callers finish.
//!
//! Splitting read / fold / compact into concurrent stages keeps the producer
//! pool fed — the light decode (the fold stage's dominant critical-path cost)
//! overlaps folding + compaction instead of blocking the fold thread. The
//! output is byte-identical for any worker count and any stage timing.
