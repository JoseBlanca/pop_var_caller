//! Stage 5 — per-group merger.
//!
//! Consumes `Result<OverlappingVariantGroup, GrouperError>` items from
//! Stage 4 and emits one `MergedRecord` per group: a unified allele
//! set plus the per-sample scalar table and per-sample, per-genotype
//! log-likelihood vector under `c_s = 0` (no contamination
//! correction). See
//! `doc/devel/implementation_plans/cohort_per_group_merger.md` and
//! the algorithmic contract in
//! `doc/devel/specs/calling_pipeline_architecture.md` §"Stage 5".
//!
//! The merger projects every sample-local allele onto the group's
//! reference span, deduplicates by byte equality, admits cross-record
//! compound haplotypes only when chain-id evidence inside at least one
//! sample links the constituents, and reconstructs the freebayes
//! closed-form likelihood from the five per-allele scalars carried in
//! `AlleleSupportStats`. Chain-broken samples at chain-anchored
//! compounds fall back to a constituents-independent per-position
//! likelihood and surface that fact through `chain_anchor_flags` so Stage 6 can
//! use a cohort-derived compound frequency as the prior signal there.
//!
//! The merger pulls a batch of upstream groups, processes them
//! serially, and emits the resulting records one-by-one in input
//! order. Parallelism around the merger lives at the chunk-level
//! consume in the [`pipeline`](crate::var_calling::pipeline) (one
//! [`VariantCaller`](crate::var_calling::variant_caller::VariantCaller)
//! per worker thread); running an inner `rayon::par_iter` here would only
//! nest under that outer decomposition.
