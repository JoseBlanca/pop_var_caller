//! The swappable read-likelihood interface `Qᵣ(obs | cand)` (Stage-2 scoring
//! bake-off, plan `ssr_stutter_scoring_model_bakeoff.md` §3).
//!
//! `Qᵣ` is the probability an observed repeat tract arose from a candidate allele via
//! stutter (a whole-tract length change) plus base error (a composition change). It
//! drives the per-locus EM, so its shape sets genotyping accuracy and calibration.
//! Three credible models are implemented behind this one trait and baked off on
//! synthetic data with known truth; the production model is then chosen on measured
//! accuracy / calibration / robustness / speed.
//!
//! The bake-off (report `ssr_stutter_scoring_model_bakeoff_2026-06-24.md`) chose
//! **Model A (HipSTR)** as the production model: tied top genotype concordance with
//! Model B across the clean/out-of-frame/messy generative cases, but far better
//! calibrated and ~100× cheaper per `Qᵣ`. Model C (two-penalty pair-HMM) was eliminated
//! — even self-affinity-normalized it collapsed on out-of-frame reads — and its code is
//! removed. Model B is **kept behind the trait** as the bake-off's reference comparator.
//!
//! - [`HipstrModel`] (Model A): the production model — explicit in-frame + out-of-frame
//!   geometric stutter.
//! - `ClassicStutterModel` (Model B): the prior `Σ_Δ S_θ(Δ)·align_subst` code, now the
//!   test-only baseline the harness still scores A against.
