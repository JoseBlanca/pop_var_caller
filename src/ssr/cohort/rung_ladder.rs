//! Rung-ladder & confident-genotype resolution — the shared peak primitive both
//! Stage-2 halves call (arch `ssr_call_parameters.md` §2, spec §5,
//! implementation plan §3.4, B1).
//!
//! Two things live here: [`build_rungs`] pools the cohort's observed sequences into
//! the **length-keyed rung ladder** (the cross-sample coordinate system §5 reads), and
//! [`resolve_confident_genotype`] runs the **model-based** confident-genotype gate on
//! one sample — the 1-vs-2-allele **BIC resolution test** (D1b, spec
//! `ssr_bic_confident_genotype.md`): it scores the reads under the best one-allele
//! (homozygote) vs best two-allele (het) model with the C2 read likelihood `Qᵣ` and
//! admits the second allele only when it earns a purity-tuned complexity penalty,
//! guarded by a depth floor, a length-separation clean-seed rule, and cohort
//! recurrence. A *confident genotype* (a homozygote, or a resolved het — including a
//! **same-length** interruption het) is the labelled seed the pre-pass estimates
//! chemistry from.
//!
//! The gate replaced the earlier length-histogram heuristic (which could not see a
//! same-length het and needed separate separation/dosage-balance rules `Qᵣ` now
//! subsumes). Pure-allele lengths are exact multiples of the period; B1 keys rungs by
//! `seq.len() / period` units (substitution variants share a length, the
//! in-tract-no-indel invariant of §6). [`sample_clear_peaks`] still exposes the
//! length-histogram peaks for candidate assembly (C1).
