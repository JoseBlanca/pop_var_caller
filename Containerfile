# Development container for pop_var_caller.
#
# Serves two purposes:
#   1. Reproducible build/dev environment for the team.
#   2. Sandbox for running Claude Code with broad permissions, isolated
#      from the host filesystem outside the project directory.
#
# Rust version is pinned to match the host toolchain used during development.
FROM docker.io/library/rust:1.97-bookworm

# System dependencies:
#   - build-essential / pkg-config: required by a few cargo crates that
#     may compile native code.
#   - git / ca-certificates: needed by cargo for git-based deps and HTTPS.
#   - samtools / bcftools / tabix: inspect and compare BAM/VCF output
#     against reference tools.
#   - freebayes: reference variant caller; one of the three we compare
#     against in benchmarks/tomato1/.
#   - openjdk-17-jre-headless: Java runtime for GATK (installed below).
#   - unzip / wget: needed to fetch and unpack the GATK release.
#   - python3-psutil: lets the perf experiment scripts measure
#     subprocess RSS without needing uv inside the container.
#   - curl: bootstraps the NodeSource apt repo for Node.js.
#   - linux-perf: sampling profiler; backs cargo-flamegraph. In-container
#     sampling needs the host's kernel.perf_event_paranoid relaxed
#     (typically to 1). In rootless podman, --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN/PERFMON
#     does NOT help — the syscall still reaches the host kernel as the
#     unprivileged invoking user, so the sysctl is the only knob.
#   - hyperfine: statistical CLI benchmarking for reference comparisons.
#   - valgrind: callgrind/cachegrind for instruction-level profiling.

# samply: sampling profiler that produces a profile viewable in the Firefox

# coz: causal profiler — built for the cohort var-calling pipeline's
# producer->workers->writer shape, where "speed up which line actually
# improves end-to-end throughput?" is the question wall-clock and self-time
# profiles can't answer. Crucially it samples on PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE /
# PERF_COUNT_SW_TASK_CLOCK, so it works inside the Apple-`container` Linux VM
# where the PMU is NOT virtualized (hardware counters, `perf c2c`, and
# `perf sched` off-CPU all return <not supported> there). Built from source
# pinned to a verified commit; CMake fetches LIEF + libelfin. Installs
# libcoz.so + the `coz` CLI to /usr/local. cmake is the only added build dep
# (build-essential / pkg-config are already present above).
