Error: no container runtime on PATH — looked for 'podman' and Apple's 'container'.

This wrapper exists to keep builds from writing outside the project tree, so it will not
run your command on the host for you. On a machine with no runtime, run cargo directly:

    cargo build --release --example <name>

Two differences to expect when you do:

  * the binary lands in  target/release/...  and not  target-container/release/...
    (the container build sets CARGO_TARGET_DIR to the second). Scripts that look for a
    built binary check both and take the newer.
  * cargo will write to ~/.cargo and ~/.rustup as usual, which the container run does not.

To get the sandbox back, install podman (Linux) or Apple's container CLI (macOS):

# **Build-affecting environment is forwarded, because otherwise it is silently
# dropped.** The container starts with a fresh environment, so
# `RUSTFLAGS=… ./scripts/dev.sh cargo build` used to run with no `RUSTFLAGS` at
# all — no error, no warning, and a measurement that looks like it tested
# something it did not. Every `CARGO_*` variable the caller exported is passed
# through, along with the handful of `RUST*` ones cargo reads.
#
# **Three names are excluded, and each would break the container if forwarded.**
# `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set below instead: the whole point of the separate
# `target-container/` tree is that the container and the host can hold different
# builds of the same binary, and letting the host override it would merge them.
# `CARGO_HOME` and `RUSTUP_HOME` point at the container's own toolchain
# (`/usr/local/cargo`); a host that exports them — which rustup installs
# commonly do — would send cargo looking for a registry at a path that is not
# mounted.
#
# **`NG_*` is forwarded for the same reason, added 2026-09-04 after it bit
# someone.** The project's measuring programs read their own settings from the
# environment — `NG_SAMPLES`, `NG_REGIONS` and the rest, which the probes' usage
# text documents — and those names matched none of the patterns below, so
# `NG_SAMPLES=63 ./scripts/dev.sh ./target-container/…` ran at the probe's
# default and printed as though it had not. A cohort-size sweep came back five
# times at six samples with nothing saying so. That is the exact failure the
# paragraph above describes for `RUSTFLAGS`, in a second family of names, and
# the fix is the same one.
#
# `compgen -e` lists exported names only, so shell-local variables cannot leak
# in. Indirect expansion `${!name}` reads each one's value.
