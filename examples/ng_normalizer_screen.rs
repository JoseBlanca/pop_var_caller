//! **The differ-at-all screen** — algorithm plan 3 (`alignment_normalization.md`), Milestone D.
//!
//! The cheapest discriminating measurement the normalization comparison has: run all three
//! left-aligners over the **same real reads** and count, per algorithm pair, how many outputs
//! disagree. If that count is near zero, differently-spelled equivalents are not scattering a
//! variant's supporting reads, so normalization *placement* cannot explain a difference in calling
//! — and a whole avenue closes for the price of one run (spec §6, §10.3). This binary produces the
//! count; interpreting it and deciding whether the calling path adopts a different normalizer is a
//! different plan's job.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example ng_normalizer_screen -- <reference.fa> <reads.bam|cram> [reads2 ...]
//! ```
//!
//! The reference's sibling `<reference.fa>.fai` is used (the contig table is read from it — cheap,
//! no whole-genome pass). Reads are taken through ng's real ingestion path (`SampleReads`), so they
//! are the **filtered** reads a caller would actually see, and each read's reference window is
//! fetched on demand (`WindowedRefSeq`) rather than loading the genome into memory.
//!
//! Only reads whose CIGAR carries an indel are screened — a pure-match read is a no-op for every
//! normalizer and would agree trivially, inflating the denominator. The three normalizers:
//!
//! - **1a** [`StructuredLeftAligner`] — production's one structured pass.
//! - **1b** [`RepeatedLeftAligner`] — freebayes' repeated capped passes; a run that hits its cap is
//!   tallied (its output is not known to be leftmost).
//! - **1c** [`FixpointLeftAligner`] — 1a to a fixpoint, which **panics** on non-convergence; the
//!   panic is caught here so one pathological read tallies rather than aborting the whole screen.
