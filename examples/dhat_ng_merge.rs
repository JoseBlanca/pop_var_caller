//! **T14 — the k-way merge's per-read budget.**
//!
//! Build and run inside the dev container:
//!
//! ```text
//! ./scripts/dev.sh cargo run --release --example dhat_ng_merge --features dhat-heap
//! ```
//!
//! Spec `sample_reads.md` §3.2 holds the merge to *O(k) integer comparisons and
//! one `MappedRead` move per read, allocating nothing per read*. A stray
//! `clone()` or a redundant move there costs throughput **without changing a
//! single output byte**, so no correctness test can see it — which is why this
//! check exists separately from them.
//!
//! ## Why dhat, and why an example
//!
//! The project forbids `unsafe` (`Cargo.toml`, `unsafe_code = "forbid"`), so it
//! cannot install a counting allocator of its own — `GlobalAlloc` is an unsafe
//! trait. `dhat::Alloc` provides one whose unsafe lives inside dhat, which is
//! the route the repo already uses for its other heap profiles
//! (`examples/dhat_*.rs`). Feature-gated, so ordinary builds carry no dhat code;
//! `clippy --all-targets` still compiles this file, so it cannot bit-rot
//! silently.
//!
//! ## How the merge's own cost is isolated
//!
//! Everything below the merge allocates per read *by design*: decoding a record
//! builds a `MappedRead`, which owns its sequence, qualities and CIGAR. So
//! "zero allocations while draining a merged stream" is not a property anything
//! could satisfy, and asserting it would prove nothing.
//!
//! What is measurable is the **difference**. The same reads are drained twice:
//! once from one file, which takes the merge-free `Single` arm, and once split
//! across two files, which takes `Merged`. Both decode the same reads through
//! the same filter, so the delta is the merge and nothing else. Run at two
//! sizes, the delta must stay **flat**: if the merge allocated per read,
//! quadrupling the reads would quadruple it.
//!
//! Comparing shapes rather than absolute numbers keeps this from being a
//! brittle golden-number check that needs editing whenever something below the
//! merge changes.
