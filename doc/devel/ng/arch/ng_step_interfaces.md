# ng — common types and step interfaces

*Status: architecture draft (2026-07-10), companion to
[`../spec/ng_proposal.md`](../spec/ng_proposal.md). This doc defines the **shared
vocabulary** (domain newtypes and the data that flows between steps) and the **step
traits** that let one implementation of a step be swapped for another and measured
end-to-end. It is a starting point to iterate on, not a frozen API. Naming follows
[`ai/skills/rust-code-review/code_review/naming.md`](../../../../ai/skills/rust-code-review/code_review/naming.md):
domain nouns for types, verbs for functions, **newtypes for domain scalars**,
`str` in prose ↔ `ssr` in code.*

## Why interfaces, not just modules

The ng plan (spec §1) is to try several implementations of each step and keep the
best. That only works if a step is a **trait with a narrow contract**: swap the
impl, hold the rest fixed, measure the whole pipeline against gold/silver/synthetic
(spec §2). So this doc's two jobs are:

1. **Common types** — a shared vocabulary every step speaks, so a candidate set from
   implementation *A* of step 6 is consumable by implementations *X, Y, Z* of step 7.
   Newtypes here do double duty: they document intent at every call site, and they
   make the compiler reject unit/quantity transpositions (e.g. a base-pair delta
   used where a repeat-unit delta is expected — the exact class of bug that produced
   the ~1000 mis-scored benchmark calls).
2. **Step traits** — one per swappable step, so implementations are interchangeable
   behind the same signature.

Two traits already exist and this design builds on them, not around them:
`ReadLikelihoodModel` ([`src/ssr/cohort/read_model/`](../../../../src/ssr/cohort/read_model/))
is step 7 for STR; `GenotypeEmModel`
([`src/var_calling/posterior_engine.rs`](../../../../src/var_calling/posterior_engine.rs))
is step 9. The ng work generalises the rest to the same shape. (The crate-level
`src/genotype_em/` hoist for that trait is still pending — it lives in
`posterior_engine.rs` today.)

---

## 1. Domain newtypes — the vocabulary

All are `#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Debug)]`
(float-carrying ones drop `Eq/Ord/Hash`), expose `.get()`, and live in one module
(`ng::units`) so the whole pipeline shares them. The point of separate types for
same-primitive quantities is that **the compiler refuses to mix them**.

### Coordinates & sequence

```rust
pub struct ContigId(pub u32);       // index into the contig table
pub struct Position(pub u64);       // 1-based reference position *within* a contig — not genome-unique on its own
pub struct GenomePosition { pub contig: ContigId, pub position: Position } // one base, genome-wide
pub struct GenomeRegion { pub contig: ContigId, pub start: Position, pub end: Position } // 1-based inclusive [start, end]
pub struct SsrMotif(Box<[u8]>);     // the repeat unit, phase-faithful (STR)
pub struct SsrPeriod(u8);           // motif length in bp, the repeat period (STR); >= 1, validated
```

**`Position` alone does not identify a base; `GenomePosition` does.** A bare `Position` is
meaningful only once a contig is known, which is why so many signatures thread
`(contig, position)` as two parameters. `GenomePosition` is that pair given a name — the
point-shaped sibling of `GenomeRegion`, and the type any "where in the genome" value should
use. Its derived `Ord` **is genome order** (contig index, then position), which is what makes
it usable directly as a sort key wherever reads or loci are ordered along the reference.
First real use: the read-order guard and the k-way merge
([`alignment_file.md`](alignment_file.md), [`sample_reads.md`](sample_reads.md)).

### Lengths & deltas — the unit distinction that bit us

Base pairs and repeat units are **different quantities**; conflating them is the
representation bug of spec §2. Give them different types.

```rust
pub struct Bp(pub u32);             // a length in base pairs (allele/tract/flank/read) — generic
pub struct BpDelta(pub i32);        // signed length change in base pairs — generic
pub struct SsrRepeatUnits(pub u16); // a tract length in whole repeat units (STR)
pub struct SsrUnitDelta(pub i32);   // signed length change in whole repeat units (STR)
```

`Bp` / `BpDelta` stay **unprefixed**: base pairs are the generic length currency both
the SNP/indel and STR paths speak. Only the *repeat-unit* quantities are STR-specific,
so only they carry `Ssr`. The `BpDelta` → `SsrUnitDelta` conversion is thus exactly the
generic→STR bridge, and it is **only** valid with an `SsrPeriod` in hand, so it lives on
`SsrPeriod` (`period.units_of(bp_delta) -> Option<SsrUnitDelta>`, `None` when the bp
change is not a whole-unit multiple). That one method is the choke point the benchmark
bug slipped through when it was implicit.

### Depth, counts, identity

```rust
pub struct ReadDepth(pub u32);      // reads at a locus for one sample
pub struct AlleleObsCount(pub u32); // reads supporting one allele
pub struct ReadWeight(pub f64);     // a read's likelihood weight (>= 0): pooling count or partial fraction
pub struct SampleId(pub u32);       pub struct SampleGroupId(pub u32);
pub struct LocusId(pub u64);        pub struct AlleleId(pub u16);   // index within a locus' candidate set
```

### Probability & quality — keep log-space explicit

```rust
pub struct LogProb(pub f64);        // natural-log probability; the internal currency
pub struct Phred(f32);              // -10 log10 p, for I/O (QUAL, GQ); >= 0, validated
pub struct BaseQual(pub u8);        pub struct MapQual(pub u8);
```

`LogProb` vs `Phred` are different scales with different bases; making them distinct
types stops the classic "added a Phred to a ln-prob" error. Conversions are named
functions (`Phred::from_log_prob`, `LogProb::ln`), never `as`.

### Population genetics — constrained, so validated

```rust
pub struct AlleleFreq(f64);         // in [0, 1]   — private field, checked constructor
pub struct InbreedingF(f64);        // Wright's F_IS, in [0, 1)
pub struct Theta(f64);              // Watterson/Ewens diversity, > 0

impl AlleleFreq {
    /// The only constructor — enforces the [0, 1] invariant, so every use site can
    /// trust it. `InbreedingF`, `Theta`, `SsrPeriod` (>= 1), `Phred` (>= 0) follow suit.
    pub fn try_new(p: f64) -> Result<Self, DomainError> {
        (0.0..=1.0).contains(&p).then_some(Self(p)).ok_or(DomainError::AlleleFreq(p))
    }
    pub fn get(self) -> f64 { self.0 }
}
```

**Validation on constrained newtypes.** Types with a domain range (`AlleleFreq`
[0,1], `InbreedingF` [0,1), `Theta` > 0, `SsrPeriod` ≥ 1, `Phred` ≥ 0) **hide their
field and construct through a checked constructor**, so an illegal value is
*unrepresentable* rather than merely discouraged. Policy by the value's source:

- **Untrusted input** (a parsed VCF / catalog field, a CLI arg): `try_new -> Result`
  and fail loudly — never silently coerce.
- **Internally computed** (an EM frequency, an estimator's `F`): the value is in range
  *by construction*, so a `new` that `debug_assert!`s the bound and clamps only a
  float-epsilon overrun (an EM yielding `1.0000001` → `1.0`) is fine — but a *gross*
  out-of-range value stays a loud bug, never a silent clamp. (The existing code already
  clamps `F` to a `0.99` ceiling; the type is where that intent should live.)

Unconstrained newtypes (`Bp`, `ReadDepth`, the ids, `BpDelta`) keep `pub` fields —
there is no invariant to protect, so a checked constructor would be ceremony.

> **Ergonomics.** Wrappers cost a `.get()` at arithmetic sites; for the few types with
> heavy arithmetic (`LogProb`, `BpDelta`) implement the needed operators so hot code
> reads naturally. Do **not** blanket-impl `Deref` to the primitive — that would
> re-open the transposition hole the newtype exists to close.

## 2. The data that flows between steps (wire types)

These are the payloads passed step→step; every step impl consumes and produces them.

```rust
/// SUPERSEDED by `../spec/locus_generation.md` §3, which specced this step against both
/// built tracks and renamed the type `SampleLocusObservations`. Three things changed, kept here
/// because the sketch shows what was wrong: it **borrowed** its reads, where the real
/// type must be owned (it is what a cohort stage merges and an artifact writes); it
/// carried a `sample` field, redundant in a stream that has exactly one sample; and its
/// per-read shape suited neither path, since both aggregate before emitting. The
/// replacement is a region plus a path-owned observations enum.
pub struct LocusEvidence<'a> {
    pub sample: SampleId,
    pub reads: &'a [LocusRead],   // step-2 prepared reads (STR path) / pileup output (generic)
    pub depth: ReadDepth,
}

/// A read after step 2 (realigned / delimited). The STR path stores the observed
/// tract bytes; the generic path stores the aligned span.
pub struct LocusRead {
    pub map_qual: MapQual,
    pub observed: Observation,       // enum: generic aligned allele, or an STR tract
    pub weight: ReadWeight,          // scales this read's likelihood: 1.0 normally; a
                                     // pooling count (>=1); or a partial-observation
                                     // fraction (<1) — the freebayes lever we mean to test
}

/// What kind of locus this is — the per-locus core routes on it (steps 6, 12). This is what
/// makes STR-awareness a *type*, not a convention. **Now defined concretely in
/// `../spec/locus_generation.md` §3, which supersedes this sketch:** it names three kinds
/// (bundles *do* produce loci — depth at least), and `Ssr` carries an `SsrDetail` (motif +
/// the fetched reference flanks), not the id/period/ref_units sketched here — the id is gone
/// (identity is coordinates), and period/ref_units are derivable from the motif and the
/// locus's reference bases. It is a field of `SampleLocusObservations`, not a separate router
/// output.
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum LocusKind {
    Generic,
    Ssr(SsrDetail),
    SsrBundle,
}

/// The candidate allele set at a locus (step 6). REF is always present at `ref_idx`.
pub struct AlleleCandidates {
    pub alleles: Vec<Allele>,        // sequence-resolved
    pub ref_idx: AlleleId,
    pub admit: Admission,            // enum { Ok, LowDepth, NotPeriodic, TooManyAlleles }
}

/// One individual's genotype: a multiset of allele-ids of size = ploidy (order-free,
/// repeats allowed). The field is PRIVATE so ploidy is not baked into the surface —
/// diploid is simply `len() == 2`. A polyploid impl changes only the constructor and
/// this type; the traits that consume `Genotype` never see the difference.
pub struct Genotype(Box<[AlleleId]>);   // sorted; len() == ploidy
impl Genotype {
    pub fn alleles(&self) -> &[AlleleId] { &self.0 }
    pub fn ploidy(&self) -> u8 { self.0.len() as u8 }
    pub fn is_homozygous(&self) -> bool { self.0.iter().all(|a| *a == self.0[0]) }
}

/// Per-sample genotype log-likelihoods at a locus (step 7 → step 9). The single
/// read-level quantity every prior/posterior/emission model consumes (spec's `Lg`).
pub struct GenotypeLikelihoods {
    pub genotypes: Vec<Genotype>,    // the enumerated genotypes over the candidates (diploid v1)
    pub log_lik: Vec<LogProb>,       // parallel to `genotypes`, per sample handled by caller
}

/// A called genotype for one sample at one locus.
pub struct GenotypeCall {
    pub genotype: Genotype,          // opaque multiset; diploid v1
    pub quality: Phred,              // GQ
}

/// The caller's model parameters — per-group error + stutter, sample-group
/// assignment, per-sample F, contamination. Estimated once by the pre-pass (spec
/// step 4, the "first caller") and held fixed: consumed as *inputs* by steps 7-9,
/// never re-fit downstream.
pub struct ModelParams {
    pub error_by_group: Vec<PerBaseError>,     // ε per sample-group
    pub stutter_by_group: Vec<StutterModel>,   // STR
    pub group_of_sample: Vec<SampleGroupId>,
    pub f_by_sample: Vec<InbreedingF>,
    pub contamination: Option<ContaminationModel>,
}
```

## 3. The step traits — swappable implementations

One trait per swappable step. Signatures are illustrative; the contract (what goes
in, what comes out, what invariants hold) is the deliverable. Steps 1 and 10–13 that
are less about competing algorithms are sketched briefly; the algorithmic hot-spots
(2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11) get the real interfaces.

### Step 1 — read filtering

Its "real interface" lives in a dedicated companion, [`read_filtering.md`](read_filtering.md)
(spec: [`../spec/read_filtering.md`](../spec/read_filtering.md)) — not a swappable-algorithm
step but a fixed prelude, so it gets its own doc rather than a trait sketch here. In short: a
`RecordSource` fills one reused record buffer, a nine-filter cascade runs #1–#6 (flag/MAPQ)
*before* decode and #7–#9 after, and a `ReadFilter` iterator yields the surviving
`MappedRead`s while carrying a running `ReadFilterCounts`. It reuses the
[`bam/alignment_input.rs`](../../../../src/bam/alignment_input.rs) predicates and constants.

### Step 2 — read preparation (generic path only)
```rust
pub trait ReadPreparer {
    /// Reused buffers — the reference window now, alignment matrices later. Allocated once per
    /// worker, never per read. `()` for an impl that needs none.
    type Scratch: Default;
    /// Prepare one filtered read against the reference around its OWN span. By value, so the
    /// read's buffers move into the PreparedRead rather than being cloned. No locus argument
    /// (the transform is locus-independent) and NO reference argument — an impl that needs a
    /// reference holds its own accessor.
    /// Ok(None) = no usable observation (tallied); Err = the run is broken (a failed fetch).
    fn prepare_read(
        &self,
        read: MappedRead,
        scratch: &mut Self::Scratch,
    ) -> Result<Option<PreparedRead>, ReadPrepError>;
}
```
*Impls to bench:* v1 is `LeftAlignPreparer` (pass-through + left-align), and a per-read re-align against
the reference for reads whose placement is not trusted (gated — the affine aligner and its trigger are
unbuilt). Every impl yields the same `PreparedRead`. **BAQ is deferred sine die** and **local reassembly
(GATK-style) is out of scope** ([`../spec/read_preparation.md`](../spec/read_preparation.md) §10, §1) —
production already calls generic loci better than GATK without reassembling
([`../spec/read_preparation.md`](../spec/read_preparation.md) §1).

**Read preparation is a *generic-path-only* step**, and that is the load-bearing correction (settled
2026-07-25, [`../spec/read_preparation.md`](../spec/read_preparation.md) §1). It canonicalises the
line-up the mapper gave a read → `PreparedRead` (production's, reused as-is), consumed by the pileup.
The **STR path has no read preparation** because it *throws the mapper's line-up away*: it re-aligns
every spanning read against the tract ([`alignment.md`](../spec/alignment.md) §4.2), so canonicalizing
the CIGAR first would be work nothing reads — and would only shift the slice the re-alignment is
handed. Its per-read operation is also a different kind of thing, producing an *observation about one
locus* rather than a read ([`locus_generation_ssr.md`](../spec/locus_generation_ssr.md)). So the trait
has **no `type Locus`** and **no `type Prepared`** — the path-owned associated types are gone with the
STR arm (they could not compile as a `Box<dyn ReadPreparer>` anyway). Read prep **composes** with the
gatherer, it is not subsumed. There is **no reference argument**: an impl that needs a reference holds
its own accessor (`RawRefSeq` in v1) and fetches around the read's span — and only for reads whose
CIGAR carries an indel, since left-alignment is the sole consumer
([`../spec/read_preparation.md`](../spec/read_preparation.md) §5).

### Step 3 — the typed-region generator

**Superseded — no trait.** This section once sketched `LocusRouter` / `LocusSource` traits with a
`route_locus(&RefWindow) -> LocusKind` fork. The step-3 spec and its arch doc retired all of it:
step 3 has no bake-off (its variation is config, and active-region detection is data-driven and
lives inside the pileup), so it is a **concrete iterator**, `TypedRegionIterator`, not a trait. Its
output is `TypedRegion { region, kind }`, with `kind` a `RegionKind`: `SsrSegment` / `SsrBundle` /
`Generic` / `Satellite`. `LocusRouter`, `LocusSource`, and `RefWindow` are retired.

**`LocusKind` is *not* retired — it is a different type at a different stage.** `RegionKind` (above)
classifies a *region of the reference*, four ways. `LocusKind` (defined in
`../spec/locus_generation.md` §3, and consumed by steps 6/12) classifies a *locus to genotype*, three
ways — `Generic`, `Ssr`, `SsrBundle`. A `Generic` region is split by the pileup into many generic
loci; an `SsrSegment` region is one `Ssr` locus; a bundle becomes a `SsrBundle` locus (depth at
least); only satellites are not loci at all. So step 3 no longer *outputs* `LocusKind`, but the
per-locus core still consumes it — off `SampleLocusObservations.kind`.

Real interface: [`typed_regions.md`](typed_regions.md); spec: [`../spec/typed_regions.md`](../spec/typed_regions.md).

`pileup/` still splits a `Generic` region into loci from the data — that is the next slice's
module, unchanged by this.

### Step 4 — the rough caller, the per-sample summary, and the cohort estimator

Two levels, mirroring the production `.psp` engine: per-sample estimation runs in
Stage 1 and lands in the `.psp`; a **cohort-gather** step then computes the panel-level
parameters before calling. (That cohort-gather step was missing from the earlier step
list — see the note below.)

```rust
pub trait Caller {
    /// Call one sample's genotype at one locus. The pre-pass drives a cheap
    /// implementation that must NOT depend on the parameters being estimated — it uses
    /// a crude base-quality ε̂, not the fitted ε. `None` where it makes no call; the call
    /// carries its own quality, so "confident" is a property of the call, not a return type.
    fn call(&self, locus: &SampleLocusObservations) -> Option<GenotypeCall>;
}

/// Per sample (Stage 1). From this sample's confident rough calls, compute the
/// per-INDIVIDUAL parameters (e.g. its inbreeding `F`) and the sufficient statistics the
/// cohort step will need. In production this is written into the `.psp` after the genomic
/// blocks — the sample's summary section.
pub trait SampleSummarizer {
    fn summarize(&self, confident: &[ConfidentGenotype]) -> SampleSummary;
}

/// Once, cohort-wide, before calling — THE STEP WE HAD MISSED. Gather every sample's
/// summary and estimate the parameters that need the whole panel: sample-groups,
/// per-group chemistry (error/stutter), the SFS `Theta`, contamination. Assembles the
/// final `ModelParams`, folding in each sample's `F` from its summary.
pub trait CohortEstimator {
    fn estimate(&self, summaries: &[SampleSummary]) -> ModelParams;
}
```
*Contract.* **(1) Per sample:** a cheap concrete `Caller` — a `RoughHetCaller` (SNP) or
the STR 1-vs-2 BIC gate — makes confident rough calls, and `SampleSummarizer` turns them
into the per-individual params (`F`) + sufficient stats, frozen into the `.psp`. **(2)
Cohort-wide, once:** `CohortEstimator` gathers all summaries and estimates the panel-level
params (sample-groups, per-group chemistry, SFS `Theta`) into the final `ModelParams`.
Only confident calls teach the parameters; **"Rough" is the concrete struct's quality,
not the trait's.** Splitting at exactly these two levels is what lets the interface follow
the two-phase engine (per-sample → `.psp` → cohort gather) instead of assuming the whole
panel is in memory at once. `SampleSummary` here is the ng counterpart of the existing
`.psp` `SampleSummary` section.

### Step 6 — candidate allele generation
```rust
pub trait CandidateGenerator {
    fn generate_candidates(&self, evidence: &[SampleLocusObservations], locus: &LocusKind,
                           params: &ModelParams) -> AlleleCandidates;
}
```
*Impls to bench:* assembly haplotypes, the repeat-length rung ladder, observed
sequences + iterative stutter/flank discovery.

### Step 7 — read likelihood (exists: `ReadLikelihoodModel`)
```rust
pub trait ReadLikelihood {
    /// P(read | allele), in log space, given the frozen error/stutter model.
    fn read_log_lik(&self, read: &LocusRead, allele: &Allele,
                    params: &ModelParams) -> LogProb;
}
```
Contamination enters here as a mixture over the source distribution (spec's choice),
not as a separate pass. The STR stutter model is the swappable part.

### Step 8 — genotype prior
```rust
pub trait GenotypePrior {
    /// log P(genotype) given the cohort frequency estimate and the sample's F.
    fn genotype_log_prior(&self, genotype: &Genotype, freq: &[AlleleFreq],
                          f: InbreedingF) -> LogProb;
}
```
*Impls to bench (the spec's ladder):* flat, fixed-het Dirichlet, SFS/Ewens
integration, marginalised leave-one-out cohort prior.

### Step 9 — posterior / inference (exists: `GenotypeEmModel`)
```rust
pub trait GenotypeModel {
    /// Run inference over a locus' per-sample likelihoods + prior, returning the
    /// per-sample calls and the site-level frequency posterior.
    fn infer(&self, lik: &[GenotypeLikelihoods], prior: &dyn GenotypePrior,
             f: &[InbreedingF]) -> LocusInference;
}
```
*Impls to bench:* ML grid (GangSTR), per-sample-GL→EM-AF (GATK/ours),
full joint cohort marginalisation (freebayes).

### Step 11 — site filtering (two traits, two questions)
```rust
pub trait ArtifactFilter {                       // 11a
    fn artifact_score(&self, site: &SiteEvidence) -> ArtifactVerdict; // drop vs annotate
}
pub trait EmissionModel {                        // 11b
    fn decide(&self, inference: &LocusInference) -> EmitDecision;     // { Emit(Phred), Drop }
}
```
*Impls to bench:* 11a inline hard-drop (ours' hidden-paralog LR) vs annotate-and-defer
(everyone else's bias stats → VQSR/CNN/dumpSTR); 11b heuristic vs BIC vs
freebayes-marginal.

### Steps 12–13 — representation and quality
```rust
pub trait AlleleRepresentation {   // step 12 — repeat-unit vs anchor-indel; routed by LocusKind
    fn to_vcf(&self, call: &GenotypeCall, cand: &AlleleCandidates, locus: &LocusKind) -> VcfAlleles;
}
pub trait QualityModel {           // step 13
    fn genotype_quality(&self, call: &GenotypeCall, inference: &LocusInference) -> Phred;
    fn site_qual(&self, inference: &LocusInference) -> Phred;
}
```

---

## 4. How swapping works — the recipe

A run selects one implementation per step. The pipeline is generic over the traits;
a `CallerRecipe` names the chosen impls, and the bake-off (spec §2) swaps exactly one
field, holds the rest, and re-measures.

```rust
pub struct CallerRecipe {
    // Generic path only: read prep is a generic-only step (read_preparation.md §1), and it is
    // STATICALLY dispatched (billions of calls, no per-read virtual call — read_preparation.md §6),
    // so this is a type parameter on the pipeline, not the `Box<dyn>` sketched here. The STR path has
    // no preparer; its per-read alignment is inside the STR observation generator.
    pub read_preparer: /* generic ReadPreparer, static */,
    // step 3 (region typing) is not in the recipe — it is a fixed concrete stage, not a swappable
    // impl (typed_regions.md). The `router` field is gone.
    pub rough_caller: Box<dyn Caller>,
    pub summarizer:   Box<dyn SampleSummarizer>,   // per-sample -> .psp
    pub cohort_estimator: Box<dyn CohortEstimator>, // cohort gather -> ModelParams
    pub candidates:   Box<dyn CandidateGenerator>,
    pub likelihood:   Box<dyn ReadLikelihood>,
    pub prior:        Box<dyn GenotypePrior>,
    pub model:        Box<dyn GenotypeModel>,
    pub artifact:     Box<dyn ArtifactFilter>,
    pub emission:     Box<dyn EmissionModel>,
    pub representation: Box<dyn AlleleRepresentation>,
    pub quality:      Box<dyn QualityModel>,
}
```

`Box<dyn _>` for the lab (clarity, per-run selection, cheap to swap); the port-back
into the scaling engine (spec §3) can monomorphise the winners to generics where the
per-call vtable cost matters. The recipe *is* the experiment: "freebayes candidate
generation + HipSTR stutter likelihood + our cohort prior" is one `CallerRecipe`.

---

## 5. Design decisions (resolved during review; add new open items here with `OPEN:`)

- **The pipeline spine is a locus stream, marker-agnostic — decided.** SNP, indel, and
  STR sit at one level: step 3 segments the genome into STR / non-STR stretches, an STR
  stretch is a locus 1:1 (reference-defined), a non-STR stretch is split into loci and
  evidenced by the `pileup/` module (data-defined), and both feed one uniform stream of
  `SampleLocusObservations` that the per-locus core consumes identically. The router is the *only*
  principled fork; SNP and indel are both generic loci, not separate branches. `pileup/`
  is first-class infrastructure (the reused `pileup/walker/`), not a step trait — see the
  step-3 note above and `module_layout.md`. ng is **not** "STR-first" as a design; that
  phrase is only about experiment ordering (spec §3). `OPEN:` whether `pileup/` subsumes
  the generic path's step-2/window traits or is built from them.
- **Reference access is one trait, `RefSeq`, with both access patterns — decided.**
  A single `RefSeq` trait ([`../spec/ref_seq.md`](../spec/ref_seq.md)) consolidates
  production's `ChromRefFetcher` + `MultiChromRefFetcher`, with three impls (resident,
  streaming, in-memory-synthetic) reusing the `src/fasta` fetcher machinery. ng carries
  **both** the whole-contig-resident and the streaming/sub-range patterns (memory *and*
  speed, and a clean port-back), and matches production's raw-vs-canonical byte split so
  the ported filters behave identically. It is foundational infra (`ref_seq.rs`), not a
  step. **Coordinate base — decided: ng is 1-based** (matching production, VCF/SAM/IGV,
  and cutting conversion seams): `Position` is 1-based, `GenomeRegion` 1-based inclusive
  (§1), and `RefSeq` fetches by `(chrom_id, start_1based, length)`. Only BED input
  converts, at the boundary, as production already does.
- **Cohort vs per-locus granularity — decided: thread the frequency in.**
  `GenotypeModel::infer` takes a locus' worth of per-sample likelihoods *plus* the
  cohort allele frequency as an **input** (`&[AlleleFreq]`, computed by a shared outer
  loop), rather than owning the whole cohort at the locus and estimating the frequency
  itself. Owning the cohort is cheaper in the single-phase lab, but threading the
  frequency keeps the *same* trait working under the `.psp` streaming engine (which
  can't hold every sample at once) — so the winner ports back without a redesign.
  Frequency estimation becomes its own small shared step.
- **Where the parameter pre-pass sits — decided: two explicit levels (follow production).**
  Per sample (Stage 1), the rough `Caller` + `SampleSummarizer` compute the
  per-individual params (`F`) and write them into the `.psp` after the genomic blocks;
  then a **cohort-gather** step (`CohortEstimator`) reads every sample's summary and
  estimates the panel-level params (sample-groups, per-group chemistry, SFS `Theta`)
  into the final `ModelParams`, before calling. The cohort-gather step was **missing
  from the earlier step list** — it must also be added to the spec's step map (§1) and
  its "what we missed" list.
- **`Genotype` beyond diploid — decided: ploidy-agnostic type now, diploid impl.**
  `Genotype` is an **opaque multiset** of allele-ids (private field, reached via
  `alleles()` / `ploidy()` / `is_homozygous()`), so ploidy is not baked into its
  surface — diploid is just `len() == 2`. v1 does the diploid math, but a future
  polyploid impl changes only the constructor and this type, not the traits that
  consume it. (Polyploidy is common in plants, so this preparation is worth the tiny
  cost up front.)
- **Read pooling / partial observations — decided: add the weight now.** `LocusRead`
  carries a `weight: ReadWeight` (1.0 normally), which serves both a HipSTR-style
  pooling count (>= 1) and a **freebayes-style partial-observation fraction (< 1)**.
  We add it up front because partial observations are a **modeling lever we intend to
  test**, not just the pooling perf optimization; simple likelihood impls treat weight
  as 1.0 and never notice.

## 6. Existing-types reconciliation

The names above are the **target** clean vocabulary. Several already exist in the code
under a different name — or, worse, under the *same* name for a *different* concept — so
when ng lands these are **consolidation points**, not new types to invent alongside the
old. Verify against the code when implementing; mappings marked `≈` are approximate and
were not freshly re-read.

| ng name | existing code | action |
|---|---|---|
| `GenomeRegion` | `Region` ([regions.rs](../../../../src/regions.rs)), `ContigInterval` ([bam/alignment_input.rs](../../../../src/bam/alignment_input.rs)) | **done — first real use is step 3** ([`typed_regions.md`](typed_regions.md)): 1-based inclusive, `u64`. Consolidates the coordinate-span types into one |
| ~~`RefWindow`~~ | — | **retired** (step-3 spec §6): its only consumer was `route_locus`, which is gone. The generator holds its own accessor and fetches for itself; production's `RefSpan` names a sequence-carrying span if one is ever wanted. Closes `LocusWindow` too |
| `RefSeq` + `RawRefSeq` (traits) | `ChromRefFetcher` + `MultiChromRefFetcher` + `RepositoryRefFetcher` + `StreamingChromRefFetcher` + `ManualEvictChromRefFetcher` ([fasta/fetcher.rs](../../../../src/fasta/fetcher.rs)) | **consolidate** into `RefSeq` (universal canonical fetch) + the `RawRefSeq` capability + an inherent `evict_before` (no silent no-ops); reuse the fetcher impls behind them. Spec: [`../spec/ref_seq.md`](../spec/ref_seq.md) |
| `MappedRead` | `MappedRead` ([bam/alignment_input.rs](../../../../src/bam/alignment_input.rs)) | reuse as-is (the step-2 input) |
| `LocusRead` (prepared-read output) | — (name retired) | **generic path only:** read preparation produces production's `PreparedRead`, reused as-is (may want hoisting out of `pileup/walker/`). There is **no STR counterpart** — the STR path has no read preparation; its per-read alignment produces a locus *observation* (`ObservedSequence` in `locus_generation_ssr.md`), not a prepared read. The old `SsrTractObs` path-owned type is gone with the retired STR read-prep spec |
| `AlleleCandidates` | `CandidateSet` ([ssr/cohort/candidate_set.rs](../../../../src/ssr/cohort/candidate_set.rs)) | rename |
| `SampleSummary` | ≈ the `.psp` `SampleSummary` ([sample_summary/](../../../../src/sample_summary/)) | reuse / align |
| `ModelParams` | ≈ the SSR chemistry param set ([ssr/cohort/param_estimation.rs](../../../../src/ssr/cohort/param_estimation.rs)) + per-individual `F` | assemble from both levels |
| `Genotype` | ≈ SNP/STR genotype reprs | replace with the ploidy-agnostic multiset |
| `ReadLikelihoodModel` | ([ssr/cohort/read_model/](../../../../src/ssr/cohort/read_model/)) | **exists** — build on it (step 7) |
| `GenotypeEmModel` | ([var_calling/posterior_engine.rs](../../../../src/var_calling/posterior_engine.rs)) | **exists** — build on it (step 9; the crate-level `genotype_em/` hoist is still pending) |

The lesson from this review: the codebase already has ~5 genomic-span types and ~5
read types, so the real risk when implementing ng is creating a *sixth* of each rather
than converging. This table is the convergence map.
