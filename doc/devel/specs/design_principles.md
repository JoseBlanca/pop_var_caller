## Design principles

A few commitments shape both this specification and the code that will
implement it. They take precedence when a concrete design decision is
ambiguous.

### General principles

0. **The caller must degrade gracefully across the whole range of
   inputs, not work well on the data we happen to be testing.** Two
   axes, and a design is not finished until it has an answer at both
   ends of each.
   - *Cohort size: one sample to several thousand.* A method that needs
     a cohort must say what it does at one sample — *emit it as absent*
     is a legitimate answer, *silently emit a fitted zero* is not. A
     method that holds every sample at once must say what it does at a
     thousand.
   - *Read depth: a few reads a position to several hundred.* A method
     tuned at three reads a site must not break at 300, and one that
     needs 30 must say what it gives up at 3.

   A single low-coverage sample is the hardest case and will be the
   weakest; that is expected. What is not acceptable is a decision taken
   as though that case did not exist, or a number that comes back
   confident and wrong there. **The data under `benchmarks/` is an
   example, not the target** — the tomato cohort is 63 accessions at
   about three reads a position, the GIAB trio is three samples at high
   coverage, and both exist to catch defects rather than to define what
   the caller is for. So when a measurement is quoted, say which data it
   was made on and what range it covers: a figure measured at 3× on 50
   samples is a fact about that corner, not a property of the caller.

1. **Clarity and readability are paramount.** They apply equally to
   this specification and to the code that implements it — not one more
   than the other. A reader new to the project should be able to
   understand both without needing to consult additional sources.
   Cleverness that hurts readability is never a good trade.
   - *In the spec:* where a choice is not obvious, the reason is spelled
     out; where a trade-off exists, both sides are named.
   - *In the code:* identifiers name what they are; control flow reads
     top to bottom; abstractions are introduced only when they earn
     their complexity; decisions that can't be understood from the
     names alone get a short comment explaining *why* (never *what* —
     the code says that already).
   - *No magic numbers, as a concrete example of readability.* A bare
     `20` or `30` mid-function tells a reader nothing; the name of a
     `const` is where the intent lives. Every numeric (or
     non-trivial string) literal whose meaning is not obvious from
     immediate context lives in a named `const` (`pub const` if part
     of the public API, private otherwise) with a short doc comment
     identifying units and source — spec section, measurement,
     vendor recommendation. Trivial literals are exempt: `0`, `1`,
     `±1` in arithmetic and indexing, and fixed buffer sizes whose
     only meaning is the literal itself. The rule is a readability
     rule, not a numerology rule: the question to ask is "would a
     reader meeting this literal know what it means?", not "is this
     a number?".
   - *Type and field doc comments lead with shape, then add why.*
     The first sentence on a type alias, struct, or field
     describes what the value *is* — its shape, what its parts
     mean, what equality means, what invariants hold. The why
     (algorithmic role, design rationale, lifecycle) follows in
     subsequent sentences, only when it would surprise a reader
     who already understood the shape. This parallels the naming
     rule that *type names* describe shape (see Naming
     conventions): just as the type name describes shape, so does
     its doc comment. The inline-comment rule above — *why* not
     *what* — is unchanged: it's about `//` annotations next to
     executable lines, where the surrounding code already shows
     what's happening. Doc comments on type-level declarations
     are the opposite case: there is no surrounding code to read
     the *what* off, so the comment supplies it.
   - *In design-explaining doc comments, prefer plain English to
     Rust jargon.* When a comment explains a tradeoff — why
     owned rather than borrowed, why heap-allocated, why this
     iterator shape — terms like "move-only," "hidden clones,"
     "fat pointer," or "vtable" short-circuit understanding for
     any reader who isn't already fluent in Rust internals. Plain
     English forces you to articulate the *actual* tradeoff: not
     "we avoid hidden clones" but "borrowing would force every
     consumer to copy the bytes itself, so we own them once and
     move them along." The jargon often gestures at a thing
     without naming it; the plain version names it. Mechanical
     code annotations can still use jargon where it's
     load-bearing — this is about design-explaining prose.

2. **No guessing at user intent — every default and decision is
   explicit.** Every parameter default, every fallback behaviour, every
   assumption about the input is named in this document. Hidden
   heuristics and "sensible" values that only exist in the source
   accumulate into systems nobody can debug later. If a behaviour isn't
   written here, the implementation should not silently invent it.

3. **Errors must not pass silently.** Corrupt inputs, unexpected
   formats, out-of-range values, missing files — each produces a clear,
   actionable error message and halts. The default posture of every
   component is "reject and report," never "guess and proceed." It is
   far better to fail loudly at Stage 1 than to emit subtly wrong
   genotypes at the final stage.

4. **Push side effects to the edges of the program — when it costs
   nothing to do so.** The pure parts of the code are easier to
   reason about, easier to test, and easier to reuse: given the same
   inputs they produce the same outputs, no filesystem state, no
   network, no clock, no hidden globals. When a function can be
   structured so that I/O happens at its caller and the function
   itself only transforms data, prefer that arrangement. The most
   common shape this takes in this project is splitting a "do the
   work" function from a "set up the inputs" function: the work
   function takes already-prepared streams or buffers; a thin
   convenience wrapper opens the files and calls into it.
   - *Example:* the per-sample pileup's CRAM reader exposes
     `new(paths, fasta, config)` for the convenient case, and
     `pub(crate) from_open_crams(streams, contigs, sample, config)`
     for the testable core. The merge / order / dedup / filter logic
     lives in the latter; tests inject pre-built record streams and
     skip the file-on-disk dance entirely. The public API stays
     simple; the test suite gets fast, deterministic, mock-free
     coverage of the logic that matters.
   - *Not an absolute rule.* When pushing the side effect outward
     would force a generic parameter through every caller, leak a
     dependency type into the public API, or just add ceremony for
     no real testing or reuse benefit, leave it where it is. The
     value is in the parts where it pays off without friction, not
     in mechanically applying the principle. The question to ask is
     "does the pure half become independently useful?", not "is
     there I/O happening here?".

5. **Don't leak implementation details or third-party API shapes
   into our own public APIs.** Every type from a dependency that
   appears in our public signature is a tie that's hard to undo
   later: changing the dependency or upgrading it across a breaking
   release becomes a public-API change for us, even if the behaviour
   we expose is identical. Wrap dependency types at the boundary —
   our own owned struct, our own enum, our own error — and let the
   wrapping happen once, at the place where the dependency is
   actually used. Internal modules can talk to each other in
   dependency-native types if it's cheaper that way; the rule is
   about what we expose outward.
   - *Example:* the CRAM reader yields our own `MappedRead`, not
     noodles' `RecordBuf`. The conversion happens in one place, in
     the per-record decoding helper. If we ever swap noodles for
     another CRAM library — or noodles changes its record type
     across a major release — only the conversion helper changes;
     downstream stages and external callers do not.
   - *Not an absolute rule either.* For types that are genuinely
     standard across the ecosystem (`std::path::Path`,
     `std::io::Read`, integer types) the wrapping is pointless. The
     test is "is this type effectively part of the dependency's
     identity, or is it a vocabulary term shared by everyone in the
     domain?". Wrap the former; pass the latter through.

   The naming convention for the boundary itself — prefixing raw
   dependency-typed bindings with the library name at the layer
   transition — is in the Naming conventions section.

6. **Typed errors at module boundaries; anyhow context at the program
   edge.** Principle 3 says errors must not pass silently. This one is
   about *what shape* errors take. Two layers, each with a different
   job:
   - *Inside a module / library boundary:* errors are **typed enums**
     built with `thiserror`, scoped to the operation that produces
     them (`CramInputError`, `VcfParseError`, `BaqError`). Callers
     that need to react to a specific failure can match on the
     variant; tests can assert on the exact variant rather than
     stringly-comparing messages. Each variant carries enough context
     in its fields to point at the offending input — file path,
     QNAME, record position — so the failure is debuggable from the
     error alone. Catch-all `Other(String)` variants are a bad sign:
     they collapse failure modes that callers should be able to
     distinguish.
   - *At the orchestrator / CLI edge:* errors flow through
     `anyhow::Result` with `.with_context(|| format!(...))` added at
     each meaningful boundary. The context names *what was being
     attempted* and *which input* — `opening CRAM {path}`, `validating
     header against {fasta}`, `merging position {chrom}:{pos}`. The
     final error a user sees is a chain that reads top-down like a
     story: "failed to open CRAM /a.cram: contig list mismatch with
     /b.cram: name disagreement at index 3 (chrA vs chrB)". `anyhow`
     handles the chain plumbing; we provide the prose.
   - *Connecting them.* Typed errors implement `std::error::Error` and
     bubble up into `anyhow::Result` cleanly via `?`. Source chains
     are preserved with `#[source]` / `#[from]` on the typed enum, so
     the underlying cause survives all the way to the top.
   - *Not an absolute rule.* For one-shot binaries with no internal
     library shape, `anyhow` everywhere is fine. For a tiny module
     where one error variant is plausible, a single `thiserror` enum
     with one variant is overkill — `io::Error` directly is fine.
     The split is a guideline for places where both layers genuinely
     exist.

### Naming conventions

These are concrete naming practices that put the general principles
above into action — especially principle 1 (clarity) and principle 5
(don't leak dependency shapes). They live in their own section
because they recur across many concrete decisions and are easier to
find here than scattered through the principles.

1. **Type names describe data shapes; variable and field names
   might describe roles.** A type alias or struct should name *what
   the value is*, not what it's used for. Roles could live on the
   binding (variable, field, argument), where surrounding context
   already constrains their meaning. The same data shape often
   plays different roles in different parts of the code; a
   shape-named type composes naturally with `Option` / `Vec` /
   `HashMap` to express presence, multiplicity, or keying at the
   storage site, while a role-named type stops being usable the
   moment a second use site appears.
   - *Example:* the CRAM merge's `type Locus = (usize, u64)` —
     contig-list index plus 1-based position — appears in three
     different roles: `per_file_prev_locus: Vec<Option<Locus>>`
     (per-file order tracker), `current_locus: Option<Locus>`
     (the locus the merge is currently processing), and as the
     inner half of `argmin_head`'s scratch
     `Option<(usize, Locus)>` (best stream index plus its locus).
     The same shape gets a single name; each role is named where
     the value is bound, and the surrounding `Option` / `Vec`
     make storage semantics explicit. An earlier iteration used
     `type PerFileOrder = Option<(usize, u64)>`, which baked the
     role into the type name — and as a result the same shape
     went unnamed in `current_locus` and `argmin_head`, where the
     role was different.
   - *Newtype wrappers are a different tool.* `struct UserId(u64)`
     exists precisely to *create* a type-level role distinction
     between values that share a shape, and that is the whole point
     of reaching for one. The principle here is about type
     *aliases* and *owned domain types*; for those, naming the
     shape keeps the door open for reuse where naming the role
     closes it.
   - *Not an absolute rule.* When a data shape has exactly one
     plausible role across the whole module and you can't picture
     it appearing elsewhere, a role-named alias is fine — there is
     no reuse cost to pay. The test is "would this shape have an
     independent meaning if it appeared somewhere else?", not "is
     this a tuple?".

2. **Readability over name length — especially for private items.**
   When the choice is between a short name that needs the type, the
   doc comment, or surrounding code to be understood, and a longer
   name that says what the thing is directly, take the longer name.
   Public API names earn a small abbreviation budget because they
   appear at many call sites and stretch into headers; private names
   earn essentially none — a few extra characters per use site cost
   nothing, and never having to wonder "what is this?" pays off on
   every review. Concretely: `ReadFingerprintWithSourceFile` over
   `WindowEntry`, `per_file_prev_locus` over `prev_per_file`,
   `record_streams` over `peekers`. The test is "would a reader
   hitting this identifier cold know what it is, without looking
   elsewhere?", not "is this name long?".

3. **At internal layer transitions, prefix raw dependency-type
   bindings with the library name.** When private code holds a
   third-party value about to be wrapped by project code, the prefix
   (`noodles_cram_reader` rather than `cram_reader`) makes the layer
   transition visible: "this is the raw object, about to enter our
   own layer." Once wrapped, the project-named wrapper carries the
   layer identity. Concrete instance: in `CramMergedReader::new`,
   both `noodles_cram_reader` and `noodles_sam_header` are noodles
   types about to be moved into `OwnedCramRecords`; the prefix
   announces "not yet inside project ownership." This is a private-
   code convention only — public APIs still don't expose dependency
   types per principle 5.

4. **Type and field doc comments lead with shape, then add why.**
   The first sentence on a type alias, struct, or field describes
   what the value *is* — its shape, what its parts mean, what
   equality means, what invariants hold. The why follows only when
   it would surprise a reader who already understood the shape.
   This is the natural parallel to item 1 above: just as the type
   *name* describes shape, so does its doc comment. (The full
   version of this rule, including how it interacts with the
   inline-comment "why not what" rule, lives under principle 1 in
   General principles.)
