# What this copy has that crates.io does not

This is `noodles-cram` 0.93.0 — the same version `Cargo.toml` names for every other noodles
crate — extracted from the cargo registry and then changed. **This file is the whole list of
changes.** Anything not named here is upstream's, byte for byte, and the claim is checkable:

```
diff -r ~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-*/noodles-cram-0.93.0 vendor/noodles-cram
```

`[patch.crates-io]` in the workspace manifest is what points the build at this copy rather than
at the registry.

## Why a copy at all

ng reads a CRAM by driving `Slice::decode_blocks` and `Slice::records` directly, and the CRAM
read path is about a third of a single-sample calling run. Two of the costs found there are
inside noodles and reachable in no other way: neither the block decompressors nor the record's
field accessors take a caller-supplied buffer, and the record's fields are `pub(crate)`. See
`doc/devel/ng/research/cram_read_path_2026-09-04.md`.

## The changes

At this commit: none. The copy is unchanged, and exists so that the commits after it have one
place to put a change and one file that lists them.
