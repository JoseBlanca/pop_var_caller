"""Genotype-LENGTH accuracy (not just detection): among truth-positive loci a caller
detects, does it get HG002's EXACT allele lengths right? This is where an STR-aware
caller should earn its keep — freebayes can flag "a length changed" without nailing
the repeat count.

Common currency = the genotype as a sorted pair of per-allele bp deltas relative to
the reference genome:
  truth : GIAB is phased; per haplotype, sum (len(ALT_on_that_hap) - len(REF)) over
          the overlapping records -> (hap0_bp, hap1_bp).
  ours  : sorted(len(ALT_i) - len(REF_tract)) over GT  (REF tract == reference).
  HipSTR: the GB field IS bp-diff-from-reference per allele.
  freebayes: sorted bp deltas from the best-overlapping indel record's GT (APPROX —
          freebayes is usually unphased and can split a tract across records).

Reported per coverage, over loci that are truth length-variant (period-aware) AND
have a well-defined phased truth genotype:
  detected      = caller called the locus a length variant (the detection recall)
  gt_correct    = detected AND exact genotype match
  acc | detected = gt_correct / detected  (given you detected it, did you nail it?)
  locus_cov     = median share of the catalog locus covered by the record credited
                  to it, for the callers matched by overlap rather than by position
  wrong_partial = share of those callers' WRONG calls scored on a record covering
                  less than half the locus

The last two exist because a caller matched by overlap is credited with a locus on
a single base of overlap, so "genotyped this locus wrong" and "never covered this
locus" arrive in the same cell. Read `acc | detected` as a model's error rate only
where `wrong_partial` is small. Before changing how any of this is scored, read the
warning above `fb_gt` — the obvious symmetric repair is a bug, and it was measured.

# ⚠ DO NOT "FIX" THE ASYMMETRY BELOW BY RECOMPUTING THE TRUTH OVER THE CALLER'S
# OWN RECORD SPAN. It looks like the obvious repair and it introduces a bug.
#
# The asymmetry is genuine. The truth is summed over the CATALOG locus, while a
# position-anchored caller's deltas are measured over whatever span its own record
# happens to have; HipSTR, matched at the exact catalog position, is never charged
# for ground outside the locus. Taking the truth over the caller's record instead
# makes the two symmetric — and grades every caller against a question its own
# output defined, so a caller scores better by answering less.
#
# Measured on ng at 300x (2026-09-11): the change turns 15 of 242 wrong calls into
# right ones, and those 15 records cover a median 9% of the locus they are scored
# at. Eight of them overlap it by 1 to 8 bases. One is a 44 bp record at a 516 bp
# tract whose truth genotype is (-96, -4); the rule would score it a correct
# genotyping of that tract on the strength of 44 of its bases.
#
# The locus is the question. A caller that did not cover it did not answer it, and
# the repair is to SAY SO — which is what the `locus_cov` and `wrong_partial`
# columns are for — not to move the question to wherever the answer already is.
#
# Filtering on coverage is not the repair either, and the thresholds were measured
# before being rejected: requiring half the locus lifts freebayes from 0.916 to
# 0.944 but discards correct calls too, because a right record is often narrower
# than the catalog's span; requiring the record to contain the truth edits it is
# graded on drops ng to a fifth of its calls, since its tract record is the
# TRIMMED tract and GIAB's truth records sit on the ragged ends outside it.
