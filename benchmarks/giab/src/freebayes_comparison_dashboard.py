"""GIAB per_sample accuracy — the production caller, freebayes, and ng.

Run it:

    uv run marimo run  benchmarks/giab/src/freebayes_comparison_dashboard.py   # app view
    uv run marimo edit benchmarks/giab/src/freebayes_comparison_dashboard.py   # notebook

It compares three callers, per coverage tier, split by SNP vs indel:
  ours-high-recall : results/per_sample/<cov>/high-recall/{sample}.vcf
                     (BAQ off, DUST off, allele-balance filter on)
  freebayes        : results/per_sample/<cov>/freebayes/{sample}.vcf
                     (QUAL >= 30, matching our caller's --min-qual default)
  ng               : results/per_sample/<cov>/ng/{sample}.vcf
                     (QUAL >= 30, same gate; alignments -> VCF in one process)

**What to hold against ng before reading its numbers.** It is the experimental
caller and this is its first end-to-end benchmark. Two things it does not yet
do, both of which cost it recall rather than precision:

  * It does not call inside tandem repeats. Every repeat tract in the BED is
    counted as ground it cannot speak for and reported at the end of the run —
    about 6 bases in every 100 of these confident regions. Truth indels inside
    those tracts are unreachable for it and score as false negatives.
  * Nothing is fitted. There is no command that writes a fitted parameters
    file yet, so every run is `--defaults`: no base-quality calibration, no
    contamination, no inbreeding coefficient.

Generate the inputs first:
  PRESET=high-recall benchmarks/giab/src/run_ours_per_sample.sh <COV>
  benchmarks/giab/src/run_freebayes_per_sample.sh <COV>
  benchmarks/giab/src/run_ng_per_sample.sh <COV>

Evaluation is IDENTICAL to accuracy_dashboard.py (so the numbers line up):
for each (sample, class) the truth and query VCFs are both restricted to the
sample's confident BED, left-aligned + biallelic-split (`norm -m -any`),
class-filtered (snps/indels) and intersected (`isec`, POS+REF+ALT match).
Truth is FILTER=PASS only. Counts are summed across the three samples into
cohort totals, then precision/recall/F1 are recomputed from those totals.

  TP = sites in both truth and query   (isec 0002, truth side)
  FP = sites only in query             (isec 0001)
  FN = sites only in truth             (isec 0000)

A tidy TSV of all (coverage, caller, class) rows is written to
results/per_sample/freebayes_comparison.tsv when the notebook runs.
