# This is an accuracy benchmark: each caller's calls are compared to the

#
# Sourced by benchmarks/lib/run_<caller>.sh and the helper scripts.
# Every value is env-overridable.

# Fair cross-caller QUAL comparison via a ROC-style sweep. Each caller picks a
# different default QUAL gate (ours --min-qual, GATK -stand-call-conf, freebayes
# a post-call cap), so comparing at those defaults is apples-to-oranges. Instead
# every caller emits its FULL QUAL range (gate = 0) and the dashboard sweeps a
# common QUAL cutoff to trace each caller's precision/recall curve and pick its
# F1-optimal threshold. So the fairness lives in the sweep, not in matched
# pre-filters — keep all three emission gates at 0 here.
